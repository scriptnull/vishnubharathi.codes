Hello! It's me, posting here after a long time. I had been a bit busy recently and things are starting to free up. So here I am - slowly trying to do some non-work stuff in my free time like reading a book and writing on this blog.

Maybe I will try to write some interesting tech stuff that I have been doing in the past months - but not tonight. Tonight, I will try to offload some life events that had been weighing on me for a long time.

(disclaimer - if you are new to this blog: once in a while I tend to sit down on a sleepless night to capture some life events that happened to me on this blog. They don't always convey something in particular. But however, this post tries to convey a simple idea which is :point_down: )

> "Don't be rude to people"

The life events that mentioned earlier seem to be mostly at "workplace". To add more context, I have been working as a Software Engineer for about 6 years now and I should say that I have been lucky enough to encounter this uncomfortable situation a very small number of times. I would like to dedicate this post mainly to the engineers who just started their career because it might be new to some of you. (well it was new to me - lol) That being said this post is universal - anybody is welcome to read and not be rude (obviously).

## Football

This is a non-workplace event (so feel free to skip). But I really wanted to start with this because as far as I remember this is the first time I remember vividly of someone being very rude to me.

I was in class 8 or 9 in school. I used to practice football everyday for about one and half hours after school in the school ground. I did this routine for 2 or 3 years (some vacations inculded - I went in for summer camp at school). I was interested in this game. When possible I used to play with some friends in a playground near my house after getting back from school. Basically, I liked kicking things around.

It was the day of an inter-house match at School. There were 4 houses (groups) in our school - a student has 1:1 relationship with a house. So, I belonged to a house. I went in to the ground with my football boots (without knowing that would be the last official match of my never-started football career, haha).

There came familar faces with whom I have practiced and a tall person (who seems to be the captain of our team). I never saw this captain in practice before and neither did he saw me in practice. Very weird. So the reason for this weird situation seem to be that I was a days-scholar and he was a hosteller. The practice slot for days-scholar is early one and for hostellers it is flexible - some do early slots and some only attend the late-evening slots. This captain always attended the late-evening slots.

So, I was standing there in the ground. This captain comes to me and asks, "what are you doing here?". I said, "I am here to play the house match". He turned angry out of the blue and immediately said, "you are not on the team". wow, just like that - how easy. Ok here comes the actual rude stuff.

He said, "hey small boy" (or some kind of equivalent - probably because he thinks I am from a smaller age group than him). He continues, "I have never seen you on the ground and you probably a days-scholar right? Run soon now, just jump off the compound wall and catch your school Van - it is probably starting to leave just now. You can catch it and be on time at home." - I think my ears went beep for a moment - I couldn't hear any other thing. I felt so much rudeness at that moment. He repeated it and went on to shower more rude stuff on the ground.

Then in a while, some of the people with who I have practiced (especially some "hosterllers") came in. They all vouched for me saying that this person practices and is good at defence. The football coach came in and says to the captain, "He seems pitiful, why not you include him in the match". I respect that the coach asked to include me in the game, but I didn't exactly wanted to there because I was "pitiful". This kicked a whole bunch of self-doubt in my young mind.

I was allowed to play the match. I sat in as a substitute in the first half and was on the ground for the second half. I got the chance to kick the ball one or two times during the match. The team that I was part of won the match.

I returned home that night. Though the victory was on the side I was part of, I couldn't really be happy about playing there. All that kept repeating in mind was the things that captain said to me "jump off the wall and go home". I wondered deeply that "wow, people could be this rude". If the captain were to "talk" to me instead of stating rude stuff and not giving me chance to explain what is on my side, this story would not be present here.

Ok, pattern 1 on people who might bahave rude: "They don't care to listen what you have to say." - so maybe "listen to people on what they have to say" if you don't want to be rude. That was my learning from that event.

I quit playing football in school after that incident. But I still played street football where there is no coach or captain - lol (and no self-doubt). Just a plain field and a football with some good old friends near my house.

uff, damn this was heavy for me - I have never shared this moment with anyone and it's been bugging me for a long time (more than 10 years). But here it is in the writing.

## Team party

I think it was 2016 or 17. I started working as an engineer for a startup. A lot of things were new to me at that point - especially the place and people. I started working in Bangalore and I came from a small town. I was getting adjusted to the new job and my circumstance there. There was a culture shift that I had to get used to. I had learn and unlearn somethings. I learnt it the hard way.

At my place, we address most people as "sir/madam" or "brother/sister". We were taught that it is the right way to give respect by default. So, I always addressed people that way and I never had compains about it. At work, I was informed that the norm at workplace was to refer everyboady by just their name. So, I did my best to unlearn my habit and addressed everybody with their name except one. (retrospect: my fault, I shouldn't have made this exception)

The exception I made was to an engineer who spoke the native language as me. I spoke in english to everybody in the company except this person. We spoke in our native language (Tamil) when we met each other in the bean bag spot. Due to my 25 years of experience in adding "anna" (meaning brother in the native language) at the end or beginning of sentence when talking with someone of higher age groups, my dialogues heavily included it. I was lonely and it felt home when talking to this person mostly because he was the only one to speak in the same native languages as me in a new world that I was part of. That person told me not to refer hime as "anna" but instead just use his name to address him. Well, my mind couldn't accept it - I was trying to be respectful and having that word is far more natural while trying to address someone like him back in my home place. But it wasn't my home place - lol, that was the disconnect that I didn't understand. I mostly continued using that word and he didn't show any "strong" opposition about it. Until ,....

There was a team party. (I think it was my first time ever stepping into what they call a "pub")

I don't drink alcohol and I requested for some fresh juice - lol (I still do this). I think I was given non-alcoholic drinks with a lot of sugar and fresh fruits mashed on top of it. Most of the team started drinking and it was long hours of dicussion, play and enjoyment.

I had the chance to sit near the person that I mentioned previously at some point in that event. I referred them as brother in my native language casually and that's it. The person was on alcohol and maybe the reaction is due to that. They reacted back with what I feel to be my life's rudest moment. He cursed me back with a bad word in our native language. He said something along the lines of "(some really bad words), I have been asking you to stop calling me that why would you still address me like that". We were surrounded by a lot of our teammates and luckily no-one understood what he said.

I have never been called out with a bad/curse word in our native language before in my entire life. I never created problems or get myself into such situations. I felt bad that the person whom I was thinking close to home would do something like that to me. I didn't respond anything, I just sat there in shock and silently retired home after the event. I never spoke about that event with them afterwards.

It was a great lesson for me. From that point onwards, I usually address people by their name. I never use {sir, madam, brother, sister}. Most of all, I stick with english while communicating at workplace.

I wish I learnt this lesson from a less-rude experience.
