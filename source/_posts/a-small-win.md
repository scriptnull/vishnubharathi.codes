What a beautiful morning! I am writing this blog post to tell about a small win (or rather small wins) that I had recently.

I read two self-help books last year:
1. [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits)
2. [Deep work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)

(I feel like that is pretty much the reading that I did last year 😅)

But the good thing is they got me more consious about "habits" and "focus" - the two gateway drugs for me 😆

In the start of 2023, I finished reading one more self-help book: [The morning miracle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17166225-the-miracle-morning) randomly as it was lying around in our house. There were some marketing fluff inside it, but I was focused on the core concepts. I have been putting the techniques that I learnt from it to a good amount of practice.

I didn't have mental model for "habits" when I started. Now after these books, I am kind of understanding it, I think 😊

So, with that, I am gonna share some of the small wins that I had recently.

## win #1 - I can meditate after all

First, I continously meditated for 11 days using this app called [Atom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.subconscious.thrive&hl=en_IN&gl=US) - 10 to 15 minutes a day.

The app grows a forest based on the points that you accrue after a meditation session.

And then I missed it for 3 continuous days because of a family function. But had the intention to get back on-track. (P.S. Thanks to "Atomic Habits" for teaching me the technique to get back on-track when we are going out of sync. I think it said 2 days is the max threshold for missing out a regular habbit. Beyond that point, you might as well not continue the habit. So if we are missing a habit for 2 contniuous days, that is when your internal alarm has to go off and think about why you missed it)

So, the forest looks like this now (at Day 19)

## win #2 - I can journal too

I started writing a journal for less than 10 minutes everyday. First I started to do it with [logseq](https://logseq.com/), but it was forcing me to switch on my computer early in the morning. So, I switched to a paper journal that I got as a gift.

My journal format is simple. one "Accomplishment" and one "Disappointment" that I had the previous day. That's all I write.

Once a journal page is filled. I retrospect a bit and see if I need to embed new behaviours to help avoid the disappointments that I had.

(Thanks to the "morning miracle" book in this case, as it motivated me to try the habit of journalling)

## my learnings

I think I never really done something like this before, yet having a good run now. The secret sauce that I learnt is

"Start small" - like very very small. If it takes more than 2 minutes on day one, then you are over-doing it (again lessons from the books above)

Bye, have a good day!
