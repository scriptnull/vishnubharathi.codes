I recently read this book called [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art). In the book, the author has introduced me to a new idea, which he calls "Resistance".

To tell what that is, I must quote a few lines from the book:

> Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance.....
>
> Are you a writer who doesn't write, a painter who doesn't paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what Resistance is.

The moment I read those lines, I had this realization: "I have become _a blogger_ who doesn't blog."

Today, I want to break that and overcome my resistance to writing blog posts. Because blogging is a soulful act for me. I find it personally rewarding every time I do it, and I always want to do more of it.

So, here I am! Opening up my journal in the middle of the night to write this blog post on paper to overcome my resistance. "Having to turn on my computer every time I want to write a blog post" has become a resistance for me. Not just that, I am sure there are `n` different things resisting me at a given point in time. But that is okay - I just need to do better at overcoming them!

I don't know why, but I am finding it fun to write this on paper. The words are flowing faster, and I am saving myself from a little bit of screen time.

I want to do more of this: Resisting my resistance.
