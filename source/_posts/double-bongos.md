I was re-watching this amazing musical stand-up comedy show called ["Alex in Wonderland"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10915930/) in Amazon Primevideo tonight. It is one of a kind show. I have never seen or felt anything like this. It is a beautiful walk through the history of Tamil music industry from 1940s to up until now. The host "Alexander Babu" is definintely super-talented. Thanks to him: He taught me a different way to listen and taste music and helped me rediscover my passion in listening to music. He would fill your eyes with tears and the next second he would make you laugh. The transition happens so fast - I can't believe how he does it.

I want to share a particular section which kind of WOWed me. If you know Tamil and have an Amazon Primevideo account, search for "Alex in Wonderland" and go to the 58th minute of the show. For the rest of you people, I have typed in the important bit that I wanted to share wih you below:

(Alex sings some of the super-hit MSV songs by live-playing the 4 beats on double bongos)

Just WOW. These songs have been heard millions of times by a lot of people. I myself had heard them but never noticed this basic construct. That's why I thanked Alex at the start of this post. We could not taste the essense of music without people like him.

If you are curious, here is a small playlist of MSV's songs that Alex performs to demonstrate the double bongos.

Notice how thoughtfully the bongos hit in at the start of each of these songs. They continue till the end of the songs.

This got me thinking and inspired. I think the lessons for me (and any of us reading this) are

### Beauty lies in simplicity

We are talking about a legend here. At the core of his composition lies this touch of simplicity. How beautiful! A little simplicity has a lot of mileage (50 years). MSV retired and didn't compose songs for movies for over 20 years in his retirement. But as Alex bets, if he had composed during that time, the magic would have still worked!

I am already a fan of "Simplicity" - the reason I prefer using Go programming language a lot :D Simplcity is not easy but trying to get there is well worth it. (Obligatory link to the famous tech talk on this subject [here](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/)).

### You don't need costly gadgets

I searched in Amazon for the double bongos and it still costs 700 Indian Ruppees. That is equal to 8.49 USD.

Crazy, right? MSV was able to produce legendary music with it.

I always advice myself and people to not worry about having not enough money to afford something to make progress in an area.

Learning programming? You don't need that latest expensive MacBook Pro or whatever. All you need is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) running linux.

oh, and don't forget the four beats.

one, two, three, four.
