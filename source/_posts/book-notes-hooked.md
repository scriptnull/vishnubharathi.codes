> As one of its findings, the study concluded that the more frequently the new hbehaviour occurred, the stronger the habit became.

> So Why haven't more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep isers loyal

> Sometimes a behaviour does not occur as frequently as flossing or Googling, but it still becomes a habit. For an infrquent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utiity either from gaining pleasure or avoid pain

> A company can begin to determine its product's habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behaviour occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the behaviour is in the user's mind over alternative solutions)

> Just as failure has many causes, success too can be attributed to a vareity of factors. However. one aspect is common to all successful innovations - they solve problems.

> "Are you building a vitamin or painkiller?" is a common, almost clichÃ©d question many investors ask founders eager to cash their first venture capital check.

> A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of discomfort

## Triggers

> Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines.

> Our life is filled with tiny stressors and we're usually unaware of our habitual reactions to these nagging issues.

> The study demonstrated that people sufferring from symptoms of depression used the Internet more. Why is that? One hypothesis is that those with depression experience negative emotions more frequently than the general population and seek relief by turning to technology to life their mood.

> Jack Dorsey, cofounder of Twitter and Square, shared how his companies answer these important questions: "[If] you want to build a product that is relevant to folks, you need to put yourself in their shoes and you need to write a story from their side. So, we spend a lot of time writing what's called user narratives.

> Dorset goes on to describe how he tried to truly understand his user: "He is in the middle of Chicago and they go to a coffee store ... This is the experience they're going to have. It reads like a play. It's really, really beautiful. If you do that story well, then all of the prioritization, all of the product, all of the design and all the coordination that you need to do with these products just falls out naturally because you can edit the story and everone can relate to the story from all levels of organisation, engineers to operation to support to designers to the business side of the house."

> One method is to try asking the question "Why? as many times as it takes to get to an emotion. Usually, this will happen by the fifth why. This is a technique adapted from Toyoto Production System, described by Taiichi ohno as the "5 Whys Method." Ohno wrote that it was "the basis of Toyota's scientific approach... by repeating 'why?' fives times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear"
