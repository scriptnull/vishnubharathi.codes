## Week 1, 2026

(Dec 27 - Jan 2)

- New blog post: [2025: Year in review](https://vishnubharathi.codes/blog/2025-year-in-review)

- At Work:
  - Shipped last-mile improvements to the AI Security Agent I’d been working on through Q4 2025.
    - Wider instrumentation across the org.
    - Integrated it with a remote coding agent to deliver automated security fixes.
  - Officially launched the AI Security Agent by announcing it to the entire team on New Year’s Day 🎉
  - Battled with [OTel Context Propagation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/context-propagation/) issues across a few services — this one really tripped me up, but was a great learning experience.

- Side Project:
  - Rho Reader:
    - Released the first-ever version 🎊 ([Release notes](https://github.com/scriptnull/rho-reader/releases/tag/v0.1.0))
    - Added several new features now sitting in `main`, currently under alpha testing in my own Obsidian vault.
