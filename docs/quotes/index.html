<p>Ideas are very important. I think that bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do and I think that great ideas in the form of great art, stories, inventions, scientific theories - these things take on lives of their own which give meaning to our lives as people.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of complexity.

It’s actually probably really good thing but to make up for that you really have to surround yourself with people who are good at what they do and interested in helping you learn….. Don’t chase names, don’t chase fame - none of that stuff. Success will come if you just focus on sort of building the fundamentals.”</p>

<p>Let me tell you what we think about children. They’re hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, “Look at her, she’s perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect – make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.” That’s not our job. Our job is to look and say, “You know what? You’re imperfect, and you’re wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.” That’s our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we’ll end the problems, I think, that we see today.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for far too many, focused learning ends at college graduation. They read about stocks and bonds instead of reading books that improve their mind. They compare their cash salary to their peers’ instead of comparing lessons learned. They invest in the stock market and neglect investing in themselves. They focus, in short, on hard assets instead of soft assets. This is a mistake.</p>

<p>If it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem. It is a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.</p>

<p>Notes: Authors call this the gravity problems. “I couldn’t climb up a mountain faster, because gravity is slowing me down”. We really can’t do much about it. It’s a reality, which could be better tackled by accepting it and moving on.</p>

<p>The only response to a gravity problem is acceptance. And this is where all good designers begin. This is the “You Are Here” or “Accept” phrase of design thinking. Acceptance. That’s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.</p>

<p>The problem is that the topics that are most painful also tend to be the topics that are most important for us: they’re the projects we most want to do, the relationships we care most about, the decisions that have the biggest consequences for our future, the most dangerous risks that we run. We’re scared of them because we know the stakes are so high. But if we never think about them, then we can never do anything about them.</p>

<p>Tackling something big like this is terrifying; it’s far too much to start with. It’s always better to start small. What’s something you’ve been avoiding thinking about? It can be anything — a relationship difficulty, a problem at work, something on your todo list you’ve been avoiding. Call it to mind — despite the pain it brings — and just sort of let it sit there. Acknowledge that thinking about it is painful and feel good about yourself for being able to do it anyway. Feel it becoming less painful as you force yourself to keep thinking about it. See, you’re getting stronger!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, take a break. But when you’re ready, come back to it, and start thinking of concrete things you can do about it. See how it’s not as scary as you thought? See how good it feels to actually do something about it?</p>

<p>Don’t let that happen to you. Go out and test yourself today: pick a task just hard enough that you might fail, and try to succeed at it. Reality is painful — it’s so much easier to keep doing stuff you know you’re good at or else to pick something so hard there’s no point at which it’s obvious you’re failing — but it’s impossible to get better without confronting it.</p>

<p>For example, in the OO world you hear a good deal about “patterns”. I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I’m using abstractions that aren’t powerful enough</p>
