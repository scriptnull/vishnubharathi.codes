<blockquote>
<p>Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsustainable for an open-ended process like research, thinking, or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement - which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception.</p>

<p>Decide before the race the conditions that will cause you to stop and drop out. You don’t want to be out there saying, “Well gee, my leg hurts, I’m a little dehydrated, I’m sleepy, I’m tired, and it’s cold and windy.” And talk yourself into quitting. If you are making a decision based on how you feel at the moment, you will probably make the wrong decision. - Ultramarathoner Dick Collins.</p>

Tomorrow would be better.”</p>

<p>If you tell yourself, “Next time, I will do it differently,” then make “next time” now. It doesn’t matter if this is about your relationships, the way you raise your kids, your job, your studies, or a hobby. If you know something needs to be changed, make that change today. We cannot change the past but we can make changes today that will impact our future.</p>
<p>Teaching tolerance for failure is important not only in the start-up world. If you have children, encourage them to try different things. That will help them develop self-confidence. Fail and recover - this is one of the most important lessons to incorporate in your parenthood.</p>

<p>Ideas are very important. I think that bringing ideas into the world is one of the most important things that people do and I think that great ideas in the form of great art, stories, inventions, scientific theories - these things take on lives of their own which give meaning to our lives as people.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of complexity. I think too many engineers look at stereotypically complex projects such as programming languages, browsers, databases, etc. as magic or as destined for higher-beings. I like to remember that all projects were started by other humans. If they could do it, I can do it too. And so can you.</p>

Don’t chase names, don’t chase fame - none of that stuff. Success will come if you just focus on sort of building the fundamentals.”</p>

<p>Let me tell you what we think about children. They’re hardwired for struggle when they get here. And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand, our job is not to say, “Look at her, she’s perfect. My job is just to keep her perfect – make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh.” That’s not our job. Our job is to look and say, “You know what? You’re imperfect, and you’re wired for struggle, but you are worthy of love and belonging.” That’s our job. Show me a generation of kids raised like that, and we’ll end the problems, I think, that we see today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only response to a gravity problem is acceptance. And this is where all good designers begin. This is the “You Are Here” or “Accept” phrase of design thinking. Acceptance. That’s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.</p>

<p>Designers don’t <em>think</em> their way forward. Designers <em>build</em> their way forward. What does that mean? It means you are not just going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world - or the real you. You are going to  build things (we  call them prototypes), try stuff, and have a lot of fun in the process.</p>

<p>The problem is that the topics that are most painful also tend to be the topics that are most important for us: they’re the projects we most want to do, the relationships we care most about, the decisions that have the biggest consequences for our future, the most dangerous risks that we run. We’re scared of them because we know the stakes are so high. But if we never think about them, then we can never do anything about them.</p>

<p>Tackling something big like this is terrifying; it’s far too much to start with. It’s always better to start small. What’s something you’ve been avoiding thinking about? It can be anything — a relationship difficulty, a problem at work, something on your todo list you’ve been avoiding. Call it to mind — despite the pain it brings — and just sort of let it sit there. Acknowledge that thinking about it is painful and feel good about yourself for being able to do it anyway. Feel it becoming less painful as you force yourself to keep thinking about it. See, you’re getting stronger!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OK, take a break. But when you’re ready, come back to it, and start thinking of concrete things you can do about it. See how it’s not as scary as you thought? See how good it feels to actually do something about it?</p>

<p>Next time you start feeling that feeling, that sense of pain from deep in your head that tells you to avoid a subject — ignore it. Lean into the pain instead. You’ll be glad you did.</p>

<p>Don’t let that happen to you. Go out and test yourself today: pick a task just hard enough that you might fail, and try to succeed at it. Reality is painful — it’s so much easier to keep doing stuff you know you’re good at or else to pick something so hard there’s no point at which it’s obvious you’re failing — but it’s impossible to get better without confronting it.</p>

<p>For example, in the OO world you hear a good deal about “patterns”. I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I’m using abstractions that aren’t powerful enough</p>
