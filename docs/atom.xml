    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! It’s me, posting here after a long time. I had been a bit busy recently and things are starting to free up. So here I am - slowly trying to do some non-work stuff in my free time like reading a book and writing on this blog.</p><p>Maybe I will try to write some interesting tech stuff that I have been doing in the past months - but not tonight. Tonight, I will try to offload some life events that had been weighing on me for a long time.</p><p>(disclaimer - if you are new to this blog: once in a while I tend to sit down on a sleepless night to capture some life events that happened to me. They don’t always convey something in particular. However, this post tries to convey something which is :point_down: )</p><blockquote><p>“Don’t be rude to people”</p></blockquote><p>The life events mentioned earlier seem to be mostly at the “workplace”. To add more context, I have been working as a Software Engineer for about 6 years now and I should say that I have been lucky enough to encounter this uncomfortable situation a very small number of times. I would like to dedicate this post mainly to the engineers who just started their careers because it might be new to some of you. (well it was new to me - lol) That being said this post is universal - anybody is welcome to read and not be rude (obviously).</p><h2 id="Football"><a href="#Football" class="headerlink" title="Football"></a>Football</h2><p>This is a non-workplace event (so feel free to skip). But I really wanted to start with this because as far as I remember this is the first time I remember vividly someone being very rude to me.</p><p>I was in class 8 or 9 in school. I used to practice football every day for about one and half hours after school on the school ground. I did this routine for 2 or 3 years (some vacations included - I went in for summer camp at school). I was interested in this game. When possible I used to play with some friends in a playground near my house after getting back from school. Basically, I liked kicking things around.</p><p>It was the day of an inter-house match at School. There were 4 houses (groups) in our school - a student has a 1:1 relationship with a house. So, I belonged to a house. I went into the ground with my football boots (without knowing that would be the last official match of my never-started football career, haha).</p><p>There came familiar faces with whom I have practiced and a tall person (who seems to be the captain of our team). I never saw this captain in practice before and neither did he see me in practice. Very weird. So the reason for this weird situation seems to be that I was a days-scholar and he was a hosteller. The practice slot for days-scholar is early one and for hostellers it is flexible - some do early slots and some only attend the late-evening slots. This captain always attended the late-evening slots.</p><p>So, I was standing there on the ground. This captain comes to me and asks, “what are you doing here?”. I said, “I am here to play the house match”. He turned angry out of the blue and immediately said, “you are not on the team”. wow, just like that - how easy. Ok here comes the actual rude stuff.</p><p>He said, “hey small boy” (or some kind of equivalent - probably because he thinks I am from a smaller age group than him). He continues, “I have never seen you on the ground and you probably a days-scholar right? Run soon now, just jump off the compound wall and catch your school Van - it is probably starting to leave just now. You can catch it and be on time at home.” - I think my ears went beep for a moment - I couldn’t hear any other thing. I felt so much rudeness at that moment. He repeated it and went on to shower more rude stuff on the ground.</p><p>Then in a while, some of the people with who I have practiced (especially some “hostellers”) came in. They all vouched for me saying that this person practices and is good at defense. The football coach came in and says to the captain, “He seems pitiful, why not you include him in the match”. I respect that the coach asked to include me in the game, but I didn’t exactly want to there because I was “pitiful”. This kicked a whole bunch of self-doubt in my young mind.</p><p>I was allowed to play the match. I sat in as a substitute in the first half and was on the ground for the second half. I got the chance to kick the ball one or two times during the match. The team that I was part of won the match.</p><p>I returned home that night. Though the victory was on the side I was part of, I couldn’t really be happy about playing there. All that kept repeating in mind was the things that captain said to me “jump off the wall and go home”. I wondered deeply that “wow, people could be this rude”. If the captain were to “talk” to me instead of stating rude stuff and not giving me chance to explain what is on my side, this story would not be present here.</p><p>Ok, pattern 1 on people who might behave rude: “They don’t care to listen to what you have to say.” - so maybe “listen to people on what they have to say” if you don’t want to be rude. That was my learning from that event.</p><p>I quit playing football in school after that incident. But I still played street football where there is no coach or captain - lol (and no self-doubt). Just a plain field and a football with some good old friends near my house.</p><p>uff, damn this was heavy for me - I have never shared this moment with anyone and it’s been bugging me for a long time (more than 10 years). But here it is in the writing.</p><h2 id="Team-party"><a href="#Team-party" class="headerlink" title="Team party"></a>Team party</h2><p>I think it was 2016 or 17. I started working as an engineer for a startup. A lot of things were new to me at that point - especially the place and people. I started working in Bangalore and I came from a small town. I was getting adjusted to the new job and my circumstance there. There was a culture shift that I had to get used to. I had to learn and unlearn some things. I learned it the hard way.</p><p>At my place, we address most people as “sir/madam” or “brother/sister”. We were taught that it is the right way to give respect by default. So, I always addressed people that way and I never had complaints about it. At work, I was informed that the norm at the workplace was to refer everybody by just their name. So, I did my best to unlearn my habit and addressed everybody with their name except one. (retrospect: my fault, I shouldn’t have made this exception)</p><p>The exception I made was to an engineer who spoke the native language as mine. I spoke in English to everybody in the company except this person. We spoke in our native language (Tamil) when we met each other in the bean bag spot. Due to my 25 years of experience in adding “anna” (meaning brother in the native language) at the end or beginning of a sentence when talking with someone of higher age groups, my dialogues heavily included it. I was lonely and it felt home when talking to this person mostly because he was the only one to speak in the same native languages as me in a new world that I was part of. That person told me not to refer him as “anna” but instead just use his name to address him. Well, my mind couldn’t accept it - I was trying to be respectful, and having that word is far more natural while trying to address someone like him back in my home place. But it wasn’t my home place - lol, that was the disconnect that I didn’t understand. I mostly continued using that word and he didn’t show any “strong” opposition about it. Until…</p><p>There was a team party. (I think it was my first time stepping into what they call a “pub”)</p><p>I don’t drink alcohol and I requested some fresh juice - lol (I still do this). I think I was given non-alcoholic drinks with a lot of sugar and fresh fruits mashed on top of it. Most of the team started drinking and it was long hours of discussion, play, and enjoyment.</p><p>I had the chance to sit near the person that I mentioned previously at some point in that event. I referred to them as a brother in my native language casually and that’s it. The person was on alcohol and maybe the reaction is due to that. They reacted back with what I felt to be my life’s rudest moment. He cursed me back with a bad word in our native language. He said something along the lines of “(some really bad words), I have been asking you to stop calling me that why would you still address me like that”. We were surrounded by a lot of our teammates and luckily no one understood what he said.</p><p>I have never been called out with a bad/curse word in our native language before in my entire life. I never created problems or get myself into such situations. I felt bad that the person whom I was thinking close to home would do something like that to me. I didn’t respond to anything, I just sat there in shock and silently retired home after the event. I never spoke about that event with them afterward.</p><p>It was a great lesson for me. From that point onwards, I usually address people by their names. I never use {sir, madam, brother, sister}. Most of all, I stick with English while communicating at the workplace.</p><p>I wish I learned this lesson from a less-rude experience.</p><h2 id="Ticket-master"><a href="#Ticket-master" class="headerlink" title="Ticket master"></a>Ticket master</h2><p>I was at work. We were seeing a strange bug which was happening randomly. I think it was a pretty serious bug and I witnessed it twice. I had previously mentioned this bug to a senior engineer. When I witnessed the same bug for the second time, I ran taking my laptop to that senior engineer showing it. We started checking the logs and trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p>It was a fresh monday if I remember correctly. A very senior engineer (who was trying to be an aspiring engineering manager) was visiting our office at that time and it was the first time I was seeing them in our office. They came down here to work from the India office for a couple of weeks. They saw us debugging something and came in interrupting our debugging session.</p><p>He talked to me for the first time ever, “what are you doing here?”. I said, “I might have run into some bug, which I am not sure if it is a bug that happens due to my local environment….”</p><p>He asked, “Do we have a GitHub issue for it?”. I said, “No! But before opening it, I wanted to confirm if it is a bug and I needed help from this person”.</p><p>In the last sentence that I said, they didn’t allow me to complete it. Right in the middle of what I was speaking, they again asked in a strong voice, “Do we have a GitHub issue for it?”.</p><p>I repeated “No.”</p><p>They continued asking me, (in a strong tone): “Then why are you wasting everybody’s time? Did you know that you must create a GitHub issue for everything?”. I was trying to explain that “it was not a waste of time to clarify a little bit before opening an issue,……”.</p><p>They didn’t allow me to complete my sentences. They preached to me the process.</p><p>At that point, I felt speechless to talk back to them and I felt the same rudeness as the football match situation.</p><p>(at this point, I guess everybody in the office was looking at us and my eyes were filled with tears)</p><p>I returned to my desk, silently.</p><p>See the pattern here, in both situations: The rudeness is mostly due to some person choosing not to listen to some other person and care to explain back them in a peaceful way.</p><h2 id="Laptop"><a href="#Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Laptop"></a>Laptop</h2><p>I am a bit emotionally attached to machines :D which mainly includes computing devices that I use every day, like my laptop. (call me whatever, but I love the devices that help me to be productive)</p><p>I was working at a place where you could BYOD (bring your own device). Well, this was more of an MBYOD situation (Must bring your own device) situation. The startup didn’t have enough funds to buy laptops for the engineers so everyone had to use their laptop.</p><p>I didn’t exactly have my laptop when joining this company. What I had was a laptop with Windows installed, which was bought recently for my brother (cousin) - kind of like a graduation gift from me to him. I explained my situation to my brother and he was nice enough to spare me his new laptop so that I could use it for a month or two to get a paycheck and buy a laptop for me.</p><p>It was stressful times. I had a lot of commitments and I wasn’t able to buy a new machine for about 6 months. I feel sorry for getting myself into that situation. But I had no choice but to use the laptop that I got as a gift for my brother for work. I think it was Lenovo IdeaPad 145s. During that time, I was trying to be careful to give the laptop like a new one to my brother. So, I didn’t remove Windows 10 and install Linux as I would do usually. I didn’t install much software. I want to be minimal and was planning for a reset before giving him the laptop.</p><p>That is the reason why I kept using Ideapad with Windows at work then. I was able to do the tasks at hand mostly by spinning up a Linux VM on the cloud and using a basic code editor.</p><p>My peer engineers in that office were mostly using Thinkpads, XPS, MacBooks, etc. (lucky for them that they were able to afford it on their own. Poor me, haha.)</p><p>There was this one engineer to whom I had approached about doubt, I guess. They sounded very brilliant with a lot of subject matter expertise. They were trying to use my laptop. Apparently, they were a ThinkPad fan and they started a discussion on how great ThinkPad was with some other ThinkPad fan who was sitting near me - while there was an I/O delay on my laptop. I guess they pressed a bunch of keys and the IdeaPad didn’t respond quickly as they expected.</p><p>Suddenly this brilliant engineer informed me that my IdeaPad is “piece of s*%t” and more heavy words. I felt bad about it. Their words sounded like judging me to be a stupid person for using IdeaPad and Windows. I tried explaining to them that this was a spare machine and I am looking forward to getting a machine of my own. They didn’t seem to care and they just walked away in the middle of the conversation.</p><p>I am ok with the “your laptop is not cool” conversation, but I wish that it was not rude. Maybe all that is needed to make this situation non-rude were these:</p><ol><li>avoid curse words</li><li>ask politely why I preferred this hardware</li><li>listen to what I had to tell for 2 minutes</li></ol><h2 id="Thanks-for-listening"><a href="#Thanks-for-listening" class="headerlink" title="Thanks for listening"></a>Thanks for listening</h2><p>Not sure if somebody read this long post till here but if you have read it so far I want to thank you for listening to me. Because that is step 1 of not being rude to somebody.</p><p>I am sorry if I have been rude to you in some way in the past. I try very hard to be not rude to anyone. If you feel I have behaved rudely anytime, feel free to talk to me about it. I will ask a polite sorry to you and correct myself. I deeply care about you and our friendship.</p><p>A special sorry to everyone who had been rude to me and found a spot on this blog post. You should probably forget that you read this, just like the way I try to forget the rude moments. I have been quite successful in forgetting bad moments. How do I say, because most of this post is an approximation of what I remember from that rude moment. I forgot most of the bad stuff.</p><p>One more thing is, some of these events might not seem rude to someone reading this. But I cried or almost cried in all the above situations. Remember the cultural gaps and workplace diversity. The best we can do is be empathetic to everybody and try respecting what a person might be going through. I wish that no one has to go through this bad feeling of “rudeness” especially at the workplace.</p><h2 id="Takeaways"><a href="#Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways"></a>Takeaways</h2><ol><li>Try not to be rude.</li><li>Try hard not to be rude.</li><li>Try listening to people and treating them in a good way.</li><li>Avoid bad/curse words.</li><li>Apologize if you feel that you had been rude to somebody in some way.</li></ol>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning! (It’s 06:35 here) I happened to pick up a book about personal finance and read through a few pages of it in the past hour.</p><p>I have always felt to be lacking in knowledge about money. So, this is just my attempt at getting better at it a little bit.</p><p>My limited knowledge on personal finance is mostly by reading a few chapters in <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/">Zerodha Varsity</a> (amazing resource, thanks to the people creating it). This time, I have picked up this book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40499078-let-s-talk-money">Let’s talk money</a>. I picked it mostly because I somehow got this book recommendation from a trusted source and the book deals with money in INR (Indian rupee) - makes sure that things discussed in the book are applicable in India.</p><p>So what is this blog post about?</p><p>well, I am planning to note down one or two things that I find interesting about personal finance here. So, in the attempt of that - I will start.</p><p>I learned something that I am going to describe below just by reading the preface of the book. LOL, the book is starting to pay off already?</p><p>It is this concept called FOIR. It stands for <em>Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio</em>.</p><p>I think this is a very good place to start evaluating how we are doing financially. Fixed obligation - is the fixed installments of money that you must be paying every month. Example: EMIs of bank loans. If we ratio that to the monthly income, then boom! we have a number that could tell how a person is doing financially now.</p><p>Let’s take the math-y approach and start with the formula.</p><p>FOIR = total monthly EMIs / monthly income</p><p>If a person is earning 1,00,000 INR per month and they are just paying an EMI of 30,000 INR, then their FOIR is 30%</p><p>The book’s author says that a FOIR of 30% is healthy for an individual.</p><p>Something interesting happened while I googled FOIR to copy-paste the full form of FOIR (haha, I don’t want to be embarrassed for spelling “obligations” wrongly)</p><p>Ok, here is the interesting fact: FOIR is being used by banks to decide loan eligibility for an individual.</p><p>So, it seems like the banks expect a FOIR of less than 50% for a person to be eligible for a loan. (as simple as it is!)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember this incident distinctly from my childhood. I had gone to my uncle’s home and was playing his video game. It was this amazing game of “Road Fighter”. I totally forgot the name of this game and had to google it to get it back now. Just in case if you haven’t heard of this game or forgot about it, here is a small clip from YouTube that might remind you of this super A W E S O M E game.</p><center><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Q5-QNfmsbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></center><p>I was a beginner at video games in general at that time. I played for fun. Of course, I wanted to win. I neither had a strategy nor cared to think about it. I just played again and again with the hope that I would win.</p><p>Well, it took quite a few years (or should I say more than a decade) to get this wisdom about hope:</p><blockquote><p>Hope is not a strategy.</p><p>– Traditional SRE saying (<a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/">Google SRE</a>)</p></blockquote><p>haha! poor me.</p><p>But I was lucky enough to get some guidance in my video game journey early on. My uncle observed my playing style that day.</p><p>I press the joystick buttons like the whole world depended on it. I will never try to slow down the car in Road Fighter. When I hit something, I get more furious and press the joystick buttons crazily - left, right, and center. In simple terms, I would get very real and try to get back on track as quickly as possible. With the same furiousness, I would easily go on to lose the game.</p><p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/5Q5-QNfmsbQ?t=422">This is how a crash looks like in road fighter</a>)</p><p>When I was facing going through a crash that I mentioned above, my uncle exclaimed:</p><p>“Just stop!”</p><p>I stopped playing the game and started listening to my uncle. He then told me the thing that would change the way I played video games forever.</p><p>“When you crash, don’t freak out and press all the buttons or even the move forward button or the (left/right) button in the hope of canceling out the effect of the crash. Instead, take your hands off the joystick (literally don’t touch any keys) until the car stabilizes back. Then move forward.”</p><p>Woah! That was it. I restarted the game and followed this strategy. The result was victory!</p><p>This taught me two things:</p><ul><li>Having a strategy will help you win (even when you face hard times)</li><li>When something is going wrong, don’t go with it - instead <em>“just stop”</em> for a moment.</li></ul><p>Even though I applied those principles while playing video games at that age, I had without my knowledge started applying those principles when I grew up in real life.</p><p>Why do I say that now?</p><p>Because I stayed up all night last night to <em>“just stop”</em> and think about the things that have been happening recently. Whenever I <em>just stopped</em>, I came back with more clarity and a stronger mindset of getting to where I want.</p><p>This is of course not a piece of random advice. It’s the one that helped in winning the games that would have been lost otherwise.</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>So, video games teach a thing or two about life after all. (maybe allow your children to play more?)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday I had the chance to tick off one of the items from my wishlist - “Give a tech talk at a conference”.</p><p>One of the most pivotal points in my career is getting a free ticket to attend a JavaScript conference called <a href="https://jsfoo.in/2015/">JSFoo</a> back in 2015. I enjoyed and still enjoy watching conference talks like JSConf, GopherCon, etc. for hours. They bring in a new perspective, teach something new, help discover awesome people to follow, etc. - Also many thanks to conferences that upload their recording for free on YouTube. I am not sure if you know the consequences of those free videos - they literally helped me build a career :D</p><p>(alright, back to the topic)</p><p>I don’t usually speak up much in real life. But I recently felt that I haven’t been speaking up much about what I am busy doing at work and also some new perspective on CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>At the same time, I discovered that the GitHub Satellite conference is happening soon and CFPs are open for it.</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GitHub Satellite is coming to India (well, virtually)!🎉<br>We want to hear your stories about open source, secure development &amp; DevOps.<br>Submit a proposal to speak at GitHub Satellite India 2021 on March 26-27.<a href="https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh">https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/N4Nxp28rHE">pic.twitter.com/N4Nxp28rHE</a></p>&mdash; GitHubIndia (@GitHubIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia/status/1358001577110368256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>Then struck the thought: Maybe I should give a talk because I am kind of doing some cool DevOps stuff with GitHub Actions at work. Maybe share about it?</p><p>So I headed to #conference channel in our work slack and told that I am planning to write a CFP for the conference and got help in reviewing my CFP. Waited curiously after submitting CFP in a few days because I did it for the first time ever.</p><p>Then came the mail.</p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-cfp-accepted.png" alt="cfp-accepted"></p><p>Got excited so excited at this point :)</p><p>Within some days the conference website was up - <a href="https://githubsatellite.com">https://githubsatellite.com</a></p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-talk-abstract.jpg" alt="abstract"></p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-speaker.jpg" alt="speaker"></p><p>Got even more excited after seeing these :D At this point, I still haven’t written down my talk yet. But passively brainstorming what to share in the talk here and there.</p><p>The conference is virtual - this helped because I am kind of shy, nervous and have definitely had stage fear :D The fact that the conference is virtual gave me a low barrier to entry. Shifted my mindset to it is going to be like being on a zoom call with a co-worker where I am explaining stuff.</p><p>I have found a useful approach to doing new stuff. It is called <a href="https://ted.com">https://ted.com</a> - Whenever I am trying to do something new I try to browse this website for videos dealing with the new stuff. In this case, it is “public speaking”. Guess what there is a playlist that I needed: <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/226/before_public_speaking">Before public speaking</a></p><p>(binge-watched)</p><p>I really liked this video called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_marshall_talk_nerdy_to_me?referrer=playlist-before_public_speaking">Talk nerdy to me</a> in that playlist. It helped in removing my shyness. One other idea that got from that playlist is “talks are essentially idea transferring methodology”. If we had an elegant idea about something that the world, we shouldn’t care about silly things like shyness to stop others from acquiring that idea :D</p><p>In the meantime came the speaker kit from GitHub! They comfortably stocked me with all gadgets that I need for the tech talk.</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GitHubIndia</a> for these lovely gadgets. 🙏❤️<br><br>Deploying them to my desk is the first thing I want to do this weekend 😀👨‍💻 <a href="https://t.co/0r3PyxCeLu">pic.twitter.com/0r3PyxCeLu</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1372945054243774467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>It wow-ed everyone around. Happens every time I receive free goodies :D</p><p>GitHub arranged a speaker coaching session that is optional to attend. I completely went in for it because I knew that it will definitely help me out. It was conducted in batches of speakers. We were supposed to get ready with the first few slides of our talk and go through them in front of the speaker coach. Then they give us honest feedback and ways to improve.</p><p>I completely bombed my coaching session. I think I was nowhere close to ready for it except that I felt to have nice presentation slides. The speaking coach was brutally honest and kind in what I was doing wrong and how I should go about fixing it. The problem was I had loose ends while talking which gave the idea that I wasn’t confident about what I was talking about.</p><p>From that point onward, things got real :D</p><p>Then came the technical rehearsal where we needed to set up the gadgets we received and check if lightning, audio, video, etc. are good by jumping into a zoom call with the event producers. Followed up by sending over my entire deck of slides to the event organizer and a dress rehearsal.</p><p>Finally, it was happening :)</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friends, I am presenting a lightning tech talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GitHubSatellite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GitHubSatellite</a> (kind of my first-ever proper tech talk 😄)<br><br>If you are interested in learning how we build internal dev tools at <a href="https://twitter.com/HasuraHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HasuraHQ</a>, tune in to <a href="https://t.co/dPngNVra99">https://t.co/dPngNVra99</a> tomorrow at 11:45 AM IST. <a href="https://t.co/kZaDH5bBli">pic.twitter.com/kZaDH5bBli</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1375479210551074818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/YXBFTDdf1-E?t=8766">link</a> to the awesome MCs introducing me and passing me the mic.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is inspired by <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">Julian’s Mental Models</a>. I will use the explanation in that blog post to explain what it is: </p><blockquote><p>Mental models do two things: they help you assess how things work and they help you make better decisions.</p></blockquote><p>Good! Secretly I have been using mental models for a long long time. It’s just that I have never formalized and called it a name and probably forget about a model and move on to using/experimenting with some other model periodically. If you have a set of thoughts that you base your actions upon, then that is a mental model for you. I would like to think about Mental models as predicates in discrete mathematics (sorry for the math-y reference, but just couldn’t resist adding it here :D)</p><p>I used to not care about mental models when there was a trend on Twitter where people write threads about it. I think it was mostly because of the theoretical explanations. So, I am going to stop explaining what mental models and try to write about some mental models that I use/trying-to-use/like.</p><h2 id="Five-Whys"><a href="#Five-Whys" class="headerlink" title="Five Whys"></a>Five Whys</h2><p>This mental model even has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Wikipedia page</a> that describes it nicely.</p><blockquote><p>The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda and was used within the Toyota Motor Corporation during the evolution of its manufacturing methodologies. It is a critical component of problem-solving training, delivered as part of the induction into the Toyota Production System.</p></blockquote><p>I learned this technique from when I was working for <a href="https://www.shippable.com/">shippable.com</a> - a lot of work and how things operate inside the company was based on Toyota’s manufacturing process. They used to even refer to the term “Software Manufacturing” for the vision of what they want the product to do for software development.</p><p>Often I have found myself get to the answer to a problem in less than 5 whys. Sometimes going and fixing all the whys may not be in your control. So, chillax and fix what is within your control.</p><p>The technique is simple: Just ask the question “why” five times when you are faced with a problem to find out the root-cause/real problem.</p><p>I use this technique to date to debug software. In fact, we used it just yesterday at work to debug <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/6600">this issue</a>.</p><p>Why did the UI show the wrong version number? Because the base docker image sets an older version number.</p><p>Why is the base docker image setting an older version number? Because the CI build failed but continued anyway with a cached older image.</p><p>Why did the CI build fail but continue anyway? (found the bug in CI script that does not short-circuit on failure.)</p><p>Also did a parallel why based on the second answer.</p><p>Why did the CI build fail? Because there a command-line program that we used in the script was not found.</p><p>Why was the command-line program not found? Because the base image of the build image in CI changed to not have it.</p><p>……</p><p>I can go all day asking why. haha - but I should say that I kind of abuse this technique most of the time like stopping with 3 whys in the interest of time and control. But that is fine and we just have to find peace somewhere, so this might as well be.</p><h2 id="First-Principles"><a href="#First-Principles" class="headerlink" title="First Principles"></a>First Principles</h2><p>This was mentioned in <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">Julian’s post</a> and is famously used by Elon Musk. I am sure that there is a good chance that you might be using it too. Because I had been using it quite a while.</p><p>Remember those moments at work where you feel nothing is working out. This is one of the models to be used at those times.</p><p>“What if nothing existed about this problem and you were to build a solution for it completely from scratch?” </p><p>Example: This software library does not have a feature or does not have the extensibility to add this feature. Ok! What if you wrote this library from scratch? What are your design decisions like in that case? Will your design accommodate the extensibility for the feature that you are aiming for?</p><p>This will try to sink you in deep thoughts - I mean the ones that you think about in the shower and make you “forget if you applied soap to your legs” level of thought.</p><h2 id="Last-Principles"><a href="#Last-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Last Principles"></a>Last Principles</h2><p>First of all, I made up this name “Last Principles” - because this is the opposite of the first principles mental model.</p><p>But very often useful. You are doing this when you are googling for something.</p><p>When faced with a problem, asking how will I solve it if I were to start from scratch is the first principles approach. Instead, asking how has this problem been solved in various ways and using one of the ways is the last principles approach.</p><p>The last principles are a very critical mental model to have. Because that’s where the learning and experience happens. You get to see these awesome ways various people are solving the problem you have at hand. It might teach you the best practices and the knowledge that the field has accrued over time. </p><p>oh! and probably save you a ton of time.</p><p>Reading a research paper is last principles. I love the way those papers build upon the knowledge from their reference papers. That reference section is last principles. Getting what I mean? :D </p><h2 id="Regret-Minimization"><a href="#Regret-Minimization" class="headerlink" title="Regret Minimization"></a>Regret Minimization</h2><p>Popularised by Jeff Bezos - also has been mentioned in <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">Julian’s post</a>. </p><p>Particularly helpful for making big decisions. </p><p>It is as simple as asking this question before undertaking big things:</p><p>“Will I regret not doing this when I am old?”</p><h2 id="Minus-Five"><a href="#Minus-Five" class="headerlink" title="Minus Five"></a>Minus Five</h2><p>This is a mental model that I learned sometime back from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sridhar_Vembu">Sridhar Vembhu</a>. He has this advice for people wanting to bootstrap their own company, “Start from -5 years” - meaning start working for what you want to build 5 years before actually starting to build it. This includes saving up money for such a long period, gathering skillsets that you need for the business, etc.</p><p>The core idea that I understand from the minus five mindset is that in order to do anything substantially big in life, try to plan and save up for those times. Because you don’t want to enter the war zone unarmed.</p><h2 id="Measure-them"><a href="#Measure-them" class="headerlink" title="Measure them"></a>Measure them</h2><p>Picked up this mental model from Vinod Khosla. Been using this for a few weeks now and I feel good about it.</p><p>I am linking the awesome talk below from where I learned this.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZcXup7p5-8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The talk ends where he discusses work-life balance. He firmly believes that it is achievable but we just have to be disciplined about it. Vinod Khosla seems to schedule his time into 15 minutes slots. Early on he had 20 main categories and each 15-minute time slot can belong to one of those categories. One of the important categories for him was “having dinner with family/kids” and he started by setting an impossible goal of 25 times per month and eventually achieved it in a year.</p><p>The key part is measuring how he spent his time to make time for something he thinks is very important.</p><p>So, if you are having this problem of “not finding enough time”, start by measuring time. Once you measure how you spend time, it is way simpler to identify the fluff and be very self-aware about how you are spending time.</p><p>Bonus: I use 1-hour slots, as that is easy to track and gives me more focus by avoiding context switching often.</p><h2 id="Lookout"><a href="#Lookout" class="headerlink" title="Lookout"></a>Lookout</h2><p>Alright, I am going to end this blog up here. I am always on the lookout for life lessons and mental models that make me better and help me. So if you have some mental models based on which you operate, send them my way. I will be happy to learn about them and possibly use them.</p>]]></content>
