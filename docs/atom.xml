    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was re-watching this amazing musical stand-up comedy show called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10915930/">‚ÄúAlex in Wonderland‚Äù</a> in Amazon Primevideo tonight. It is one of a kind show. I have never seen or felt anything like this. It is a beautiful walk through the history of Tamil music industry from 1940s to up until now. The host ‚ÄúAlexander Babu‚Äù is definintely super-talented. Thanks to him: He taught me a different way to listen and taste music and helped me rediscover my passion in listening to music. He will fill your eyes with tears one second and make you laugh the next second. The transition happens so fast - I can‚Äôt believe how he does it.</p><p>I want to share a particular section which WOWed me. If you know Tamil and have an Amazon Primevideo account, search for ‚ÄúAlex in Wonderland‚Äù and go to the 58th minute of the show. For the rest of you people, I have typed in the bits that I wanted to share with you:</p><p>Alex says:</p><blockquote><p>Think about this simple instrument</p><p>You know the name of this instrument?</p><p>It is called the Double Bongos right?</p><p>One of the simplest percussion rhythm instruments.</p><p>And you can buy this for 700 ruppees in Chennai even today.</p><p>And will you belive if I say this simple instrument ruled Tamil Film Music for half a century man?</p><p>I am not exaggerating.</p><p>For 50 years every other super hit song that came in Tamil film music had only this instrument as the core rhythm instrument.</p><p>This sound I‚Äôm sure you can all recall‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</p><p>(plays the double bongos)</p><p>This sound ruled Tamil film music for half a century.</p><p>This music director we all adore. He will live forever. He‚Äôs living forever.</p><p>He made amazing, wonderful, soulful songs.</p><p>The melodies will be out of the world.</p><p>But the percussion: just bongos and nothing else.</p><p>Of-course I am talking about the King of Melodies ‚ÄúM S Viswanathan‚Äù (fondly called MSV)</p><p>I think MSV wants to tell us one thing very clearly.</p><p>Beauty lies in simplicity.</p><p>Even on Bongos he wouldn‚Äôt complicate.</p><p>He would not go into the complex rhythm patterns and all.</p><p>Just the 4-beat rhythm for every song ya.</p><p>This four beat: one, two, three, four, that‚Äôs all.</p><p>Whatever maybe the situation. Whatever maybe the emotion that he has to show. Anything that ever happens in any story, for anybody‚Äôs life, MSV has captured anything and everything in this 4-beat rhythm.</p><p>one two three four.</p></blockquote><p>(Alex sings some of the super-hit MSV songs by live-playing the four beats on double bongos)</p><p>Just WOW. These songs have been heard millions of times by a lot of people. I myself had heard them but never noticed this basic construct. That‚Äôs why I thanked Alex at the start of this post. We could not taste the essense of music without people like him.</p><p>If you are curious, here is a small playlist of MSV‚Äôs songs that Alex performs to demonstrate the double bongos.</p><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6QoFkkY3JyeslWhlHE4BVG?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe><p>Notice how thoughtfully the bongos hit in at the start of each song. They continue in harmony throughout every song.</p><p>This got me thinking and inspired. I think the lessons for me (and any of us reading this) are</p><h3 id="Beauty-lies-in-simplicity"><a href="#Beauty-lies-in-simplicity" class="headerlink" title="Beauty lies in simplicity"></a>Beauty lies in simplicity</h3><p>We are talking about a legend here. At the core of his compositions lies this touch of simplicity. How beautiful! A little simplicity has a lot of mileage (50 years). MSV retired and didn‚Äôt compose songs for movies for over 20 years in his retirement. But as Alex bets, if he had composed during that time, the magic would have still worked!</p><p>I am already a fan of ‚ÄúSimplicity‚Äù - the reason I prefer using Go programming language a lot :D Simplcity is not easy, but trying to get there is well worth it. (Obligatory link to the famous tech talk on this subject <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">here</a>).</p><h3 id="You-don‚Äôt-need-costly-gadgets"><a href="#You-don‚Äôt-need-costly-gadgets" class="headerlink" title="You don‚Äôt need costly gadgets"></a>You don‚Äôt need costly gadgets</h3><p>I searched Amazon for the double bongos and it still costs 700 Indian Ruppees. That is equal to 8.49 USD.</p><p>Crazy, right? MSV was able to produce legendary music with it.</p><p>I always advice myself and people to not worry about not having enough money to afford something to make progress in an area.</p><p>Learning programming? You don‚Äôt need that latest expensive MacBook Pro or whatever. All you need is a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> running linux.</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~</p><p>oh, and don‚Äôt forget the four beats of the double bongos.</p><p>one, two, three, four.</p>]]></content>

Because we are getting the <code>eventBus := ctx.Value(&quot;eventBus&quot;).(event.Bus)</code> at runtime and we missed setting that value via <code>context.WithValue</code>, we will get back a nil reference.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a long long time, I managed to attend a hackathon - <a href="https://fossunited.org/fosshack/2023">FOSS Hack 3.0</a></p><h2 id="Confession"><a href="#Confession" class="headerlink" title="Confession"></a>Confession</h2><p>I have a confession to make.</p><p>I have had a secret hackathon burnout all these years. The last time I attended a hackathon might have been in 2016 or 2017.</p><p>But this hackathon is different. I didn‚Äôt face any burnout or pressure.</p><p>Instead, I just kept working on what I wanted to work on.</p><p>One of the things that I did differently in this event compared to my previous hackathons is to work on a project that I would use in the real world.</p><p>In my previous hackathons, I used to work on some random app(s) or game(s) which was far out of my reach. This time: I had a well-scoped and practical idea.</p><p>Besides, this hackathon is very special to me - because it is for building Open-source software. How cool is it! (dreamed about something like this to happen in India around 2013-14-ish timeline)</p><h2 id="And-my-new-project-is"><a href="#And-my-new-project-is" class="headerlink" title="And my new project is"></a>And my new project is</h2><p>I worked on a new project called <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond">waymond</a> which I had been looking to get started on for a long time. I used the hackathon as an excuse to work on it üòÄ</p><blockquote><p>waymond is</p><ul><li>An open-source autoscaler.</li><li>Aiming to provide autoscaling for a wide variety of infrastructure.</li><li>Modular and extensible.</li><li>Built with Go.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The project‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond#readme">README</a> contains a good deal of information about the project if you are interested. If you find it useful/interesting, consider giving a üåü on <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond">GitHub</a> - helps with my dopamine levels üòÖ</p><p>I got the chance to learn some Go and explore some libraries while working on the project. I want to share all my learnings here in this blog. At the same time, I would love to keep working and maintaining the project moving forward.</p><h2 id="Progress"><a href="#Progress" class="headerlink" title="Progress"></a>Progress</h2><p>I was able to make <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond/releases/tag/v0.1.0">v0.1.0 release</a>:</p><ul><li>Helped me arrive at a design for the system</li><li>Helped me in prototyping a very basic use case</li><li>Helped me to write the ‚Äúcore‚Äù parts of the software. (of course, I might most probably need to refactor it once I have a better understanding)</li><li>Gave me the chance to write an elaborate README for the project</li></ul><p>I already prepared a thin milestone <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond/milestone/1">v0.2.0</a> for the project. The aim is to deploy it on real-world workloads (yeah, I do have them and will talk about it in detail once I am there)</p><h2 id="Demo"><a href="#Demo" class="headerlink" title="Demo"></a>Demo</h2><p>I also recorded a <a href="https://youtu.be/DuKksePAJ_o">small demo</a> to show my progress so far (also needed to submit it at the end of the hackathon)</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuKksePAJ_o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><h2 id="Online-and-solo-this-time"><a href="#Online-and-solo-this-time" class="headerlink" title="Online and solo this time"></a>Online and solo this time</h2><p>It was happening both in-person and online. I attended it online, as I couldn‚Äôt travel to Bangalore at the moment.</p><p>Also, I had to do some solo hacking this time. Because the project that I have been working on is in its very early stages and it would have been hard to collaborate with a team. (so, I didn‚Äôt want to disturb my friends with lot of unknowns at this point.)</p><p>But I wished the opposite in both cases:</p><ul><li>I wished to attend it online.</li><li>I wished to work on it with a team.</li></ul><p>maybe next time!</p><p>But the good thing is I was able to make some decent progress on the project and it is already at an ok-ish level to accept Open Source contributions for it. So, if you are looking to contribute to an OSS project written in Go, then this is your chance! Take a look at the issue tracker <a href="https://github.com/scriptnull/waymond/issues">here</a>.</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~</p><p>I am still very shy to show my code, but it‚Äôs a hackathon project - so I hope you wouldn‚Äôt mind my 222 lines long <code>main.go</code> file.</p>]]></content>

There was some marketing fluff inside it, but I was focused on the core concepts.

But had the intention to get back on track. (P.S. Thanks to ‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù for teaching me the technique to get back on track when we are going out of sync. I think it said 2 days is the max threshold for missing out on a regular habit. Beyond that point, you might as well not continue the habit. So if we are missing a habit for 2 continuous days, that is when our internal alarm has to go off and think about why we missed it)</p><p>So, the forest looks like this now (on Day 19)</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4211715/222611224-00093342-bf7e-4dce-8f9b-0609a6ea8db6.png" alt="image"></p><h2 id="win-2-I-can-journal-too"><a href="#win-2-I-can-journal-too" class="headerlink" title="win #2 - I can journal too"></a>win #2 - I can journal too</h2><p>I started writing a journal for less than 10 minutes every day.

That‚Äôs all I write.</p><p>Once a journal page is filled.
