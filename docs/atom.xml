    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had the chance to read through this book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22668729-hooked">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a>. It is my attempt at bringing back the “builder” spirit. I have worked on side projects that are literally whatever I like to do with my time at any given point - LOL :D</p><p>So, I thought I will learn how some good products are getting built. Apart from that, this book is about “habit-forming products”. By this time, I have realized that I have a “habit” of using certain things every day - I don’t even know how it became a habit, but it is a habit for me now (example: picking up the phone to check Twitter). So, I was curious to understand how I ended up like this and probably use the book in reverse-effect to control my habits (so that they don’t become an addiction).</p><p>Overall, I liked the book and I am going to have a “worksheet” of things discussed in the book before I start building anything new. So, I am writing this blog post to revise the notes when it is needed. The entire post is mostly my “notes and highlights” from the book.</p><blockquote><p>As one of its findings, the study concluded that the more frequently the new behavior occurred, the stronger the habit became.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So Why haven’t more Google users switched to Bing? Habits keep users loyal</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sometimes a behavior does not occur as frequently as flossing or Googling, but it still becomes a habit. For an infrequent action to become a habit, the user must perceive a high degree of utility either from gaining pleasure or avoiding pain</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A company can begin to determine its product’s habit-forming potential by plotting two factors: frequency (how often the behavior occurs) and perceived utility (how useful and rewarding the behavior is in the user’s mind over alternative solutions)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Just as failure has many causes, success too can be attributed to a variety of factors. However. one aspect is common to all successful innovations - they solve problems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Are you building a vitamin or painkiller?” is a common, almost clichéd question many investors ask founders eager to cash their first venture capital check.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of discomfort</p></blockquote><p>The book introduces four parameters that we should think about while building new products. They are</p><ul><li>Trigger</li><li>Action</li><li>Variable Reward</li><li>Investment</li></ul><h2 id="Triggers"><a href="#Triggers" class="headerlink" title="Triggers"></a>Triggers</h2><p>A trigger is something that triggers the user to use your product. There are two kinds of triggers: External and Internal triggers.</p><p>External triggers:</p><ul><li>Paid Triggers: Advertising, search engine marketing, etc.</li><li>Earned Triggers: Favourable Press mentions, features on the app store, etc.</li><li>Relationship Triggers: Word of mouth, referrals, somebody shared on social media, etc.</li><li>Owned Triggers: Email newsletter to which user is subscribed, app icon on user’s iPhone screen, bookmarks, app notifications, etc.</li></ul><p>Internal triggers:<br>You can’t see, touch, or hear an internal trigger. It is completely internal to the user. They probably are triggered due to the feelings/emotions/state of mind of the user.</p><p>When do you use Instagram? FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out updates from your friends (fear is the emotion)</p><blockquote><p>Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Our life is filled with tiny stressors and we’re usually unaware of our habitual reactions to these nagging issues.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The study demonstrated that people suffering from symptoms of depression used the Internet more. Why is that? One hypothesis is that those with depression experience negative emotions more frequently than the general population and seek relief by turning to technology to life their mood.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Square, shared how his companies answer these important questions: “[If] you want to build a product that is relevant to folks, you need to put yourself in their shoes and you need to write a story from their side. So, we spend a lot of time writing what’s called user narratives.</p><p>Dorsey goes on to describe how he tried to truly understand his user: “He is in the middle of Chicago and they go to a coffee store … This is the experience they’re going to have. It reads like a play. It’s really, really beautiful. If you do that story well, then all of the prioritization, all of the product, all of the design, and all the coordination that you need to do with these products just falls out naturally because you can edit the story and everyone can relate to the story from all levels of an organization, engineers to operation to support to designers to the business side of the house.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One method is to try asking the question “Why? as many times as it takes to get to emotion. Usually, this will happen by the fifth why. This is a technique adapted from Toyota Production System, described by Taiichi Ohno as the “5 Whys Method.” Ohno wrote that it was “the basis of Toyota’s scientific approach… by repeating ‘why?’ fives times, the nature of the problem, as well as its solution, becomes clear”</p></blockquote><h2 id="Action"><a href="#Action" class="headerlink" title="Action"></a>Action</h2><blockquote><p>Fogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.</p><p>The Fogg Behaviour Model is represented in the formula B = MAT, which represents that a given behavior will occur when motivation, ability, and a trigger are present at the same time and insufficient degrees.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Evan Williams, co-founder of Blogger, Twitter, and Medium, echoes Hauptly’s formula for innovation when he describes his own approach to building three massively successful companies:</p><p>“Take a human desire, preferably one that has been around for a really long time… Identify that desire and use modern technology to take out steps.”</p></blockquote><p>The book introduces something called “Fogg’s elements of simplicity”. These are the factors that influence a task’s difficulty. They are</p><ul><li>Time - how long it takes to complete an action.</li><li>Money - the fiscal cost of taking an action.</li><li>Physical effort - the amount of labor involved in taking the action.</li><li>Brain cycles - the level of mental effort and the focus required to take an action.</li><li>Social deviance - how accepted the behavior is by others</li><li>Non-routine - according to Fogg, “How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines”</li></ul><blockquote><p>To increase the likelihood that a behavior will occur, Fogg instructs designers to focus on simplicity as a function of the user’s scarcest resource at that moment. In other words: Identify what the user is missing. What is making it difficult for the user to accomplish the desired action?</p><p>Is the user short on time? Is the behavior too expensive? Is the user exhausted after a long day of work? Is the product too difficult to understand? Is the user in a social context where the behavior could be perceived as inappropriate? Is the behavior simply so far removed from the user’s normal routine that its strangeness is off-putting?</p><p>These factors will differ by person and context: therefore, designers should ask, “What is the thing that is missing that would allow my users to proceed to the next step?” Designing with an eye toward simplifying the overall user experience reduces friction, removes obstacles, and helps push the user across Fogg’s action line.</p></blockquote><p>I have come across various brain “biases”. I felt it to be mostly psychological theory. But the book picked up four biases in particular and tries to explain with help of examples. (Found it to be practical)</p><ul><li>The Scarcity Effect - This is why Amazon shows “1 out of 10 remaining in stock”</li><li>The Framing Effect - This is why you should care about the design of the box you package your product with.</li><li>The Anchoring Effect - “Buy one, get two”, “Shops that have 20% off always”</li><li>The Endowed Progress Effect - This is why most sign-up flows show progress (Like Linkedin showing 80% complete to making you fill to becomes an “All-star” profile”)</li></ul><blockquote><p>The appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The study demonstrates the endowed progress effect, a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Variable-Reward"><a href="#Variable-Reward" class="headerlink" title="Variable Reward"></a>Variable Reward</h2><blockquote><p>Reward your users by solving a problem, reinforcing their motivation for the action taken in the previous phase.</p></blockquote><p>I think variable rewards pay for internal triggers. This section like many sections in the book is filled with research data and past experiments.</p><p>The variable reward comes in three types:</p><ul><li>Rewards of the Tribe: Facebook Likes and comments.Stack overflow upvotes of answers.</li><li>Rewards of the Hunt: Twitter’s feed and Pinterest’s endless scroll.</li><li>Rewards of the Self: Video games, Codecademy’s progress bar on skill development.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The magic words the researchers discovered? The phrase “But you are free to accept or refuse”</p><p>The “but you are free” technique demonstrates how we are more likely to be persuaded to give when our ability to choose is reaffirmed. Not only was the effect observed during face-to-face interactions, but also over email. Although the research did not directly look at how products and services might use the technique, the study provides an important insight into how companies maintain or lose the user’s attention.”</p></blockquote><h2 id="Investment"><a href="#Investment" class="headerlink" title="Investment"></a>Investment</h2><blockquote><p>Unlike its competitors who sell preassembled merchandise, IKEA puts its customers to work. It turns out there’s a hidden benefit to making users invest physical effort in assembling the product - by asking customers to assemble their own furniture, Ariely believes they adopt an irrational love of the furniture they built, just like the test subjects did in the origami experiments. Business that leverage user effort confers higher value to their products simply because their users have put work into them. The users have invested in the products through their labor.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Studies reveal that our past is an excellent predictor of our future.</p></blockquote><p>The product has to provide “value” to keep the user invested in the product. Some ways of providing value:</p><ul><li>Content: Spotify’s users consume the content it provides. Spotify generates “Discover Weekly” based on content consumption which provides more value to the user who invested in listening on Spotify.</li><li>Data: Mint.com stores all the financial data of a user.</li><li>Followers: Investing in following the right people on Twitter improves the service for the user.</li><li>Reputation: Online marketplaces such as eBay, Upwork, Yelp, and Airbnb, people with negative scores are treated very differently from those with good reputations.</li><li>Skill: Investing time and effort into learning to use a product is a form of investment and stored value. Example: Learning Adobe Photoshop is an investment that adds design skills to the users as a result of which they are more invested in the product.</li></ul><h2 id="Habit-Testing"><a href="#Habit-Testing" class="headerlink" title="Habit Testing"></a>Habit Testing</h2><blockquote><p>For example, in its early days, Twitter discovered that once new users followed thirty other members, they hit a tipping point that dramatically increased the odds they would keep using the site.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Twitter used the insights gained from the previous step to modify its onboarding process, encouraging new users to immediately begin following others.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Bonus"><a href="#Bonus" class="headerlink" title="Bonus"></a>Bonus</h2><p>Throughout the book, I felt that the author applied the principles to the book itself. One thing that put a smile on my face was during the closing chapter of the book, the authors say this</p><blockquote><p>Also, it would mean so much to me if you could take a moment to review the book online, “but you are free to accept or refuse”</p></blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! It’s me, posting here after a long time. I had been a bit busy recently and things are starting to free up. So here I am - slowly trying to do some non-work stuff in my free time like reading a book and writing on this blog.</p><p>Maybe I will try to write some interesting tech stuff that I have been doing in the past months - but not tonight. Tonight, I will try to offload some life events that had been weighing on me for a long time.</p><p>(disclaimer - if you are new to this blog: once in a while I tend to sit down on a sleepless night to capture some life events that happened to me. They don’t always convey something in particular. However, this post tries to convey something which is :point_down: )</p><blockquote><p>“Don’t be rude to people”</p></blockquote><p>The life events mentioned earlier seem to be mostly at the “workplace”. To add more context, I have been working as a Software Engineer for about 6 years now and I should say that I have been lucky enough to encounter this uncomfortable situation a very small number of times. I would like to dedicate this post mainly to the engineers who just started their careers because it might be new to some of you. (well it was new to me - lol) That being said this post is universal - anybody is welcome to read and not be rude (obviously).</p><h2 id="Football"><a href="#Football" class="headerlink" title="Football"></a>Football</h2><p>This is a non-workplace event (so feel free to skip). But I really wanted to start with this because as far as I remember this is the first time I remember vividly someone being very rude to me.</p><p>I was in class 8 or 9 in school. I used to practice football every day for about one and half hours after school on the school ground. I did this routine for 2 or 3 years (some vacations included - I went in for summer camp at school). I was interested in this game. When possible I used to play with some friends in a playground near my house after getting back from school. Basically, I liked kicking things around.</p><p>It was the day of an inter-house match at School. There were 4 houses (groups) in our school - a student has a 1:1 relationship with a house. So, I belonged to a house. I went into the ground with my football boots (without knowing that would be the last official match of my never-started football career, haha).</p><p>There came familiar faces with whom I have practiced and a tall person (who seems to be the captain of our team). I never saw this captain in practice before and neither did he see me in practice. Very weird. So the reason for this weird situation seems to be that I was a days-scholar and he was a hosteller. The practice slot for days-scholar is early one and for hostellers it is flexible - some do early slots and some only attend the late-evening slots. This captain always attended the late-evening slots.</p><p>So, I was standing there on the ground. This captain comes to me and asks, “what are you doing here?”. I said, “I am here to play the house match”. He turned angry out of the blue and immediately said, “you are not on the team”. wow, just like that - how easy. Ok here comes the actual rude stuff.</p><p>He said, “hey small boy” (or some kind of equivalent - probably because he thinks I am from a smaller age group than him). He continues, “I have never seen you on the ground and you probably a days-scholar right? Run soon now, just jump off the compound wall and catch your school Van - it is probably starting to leave just now. You can catch it and be on time at home.” - I think my ears went beep for a moment - I couldn’t hear any other thing. I felt so much rudeness at that moment. He repeated it and went on to shower more rude stuff on the ground.</p><p>Then in a while, some of the people with who I have practiced (especially some “hostellers”) came in. They all vouched for me saying that this person practices and is good at defense. The football coach came in and says to the captain, “He seems pitiful, why not you include him in the match”. I respect that the coach asked to include me in the game, but I didn’t exactly want to there because I was “pitiful”. This kicked a whole bunch of self-doubt in my young mind.</p><p>I was allowed to play the match. I sat in as a substitute in the first half and was on the ground for the second half. I got the chance to kick the ball one or two times during the match. The team that I was part of won the match.</p><p>I returned home that night. Though the victory was on the side I was part of, I couldn’t really be happy about playing there. All that kept repeating in mind was the things that captain said to me “jump off the wall and go home”. I wondered deeply that “wow, people could be this rude”. If the captain were to “talk” to me instead of stating rude stuff and not giving me chance to explain what is on my side, this story would not be present here.</p><p>Ok, pattern 1 on people who might behave rude: “They don’t care to listen to what you have to say.” - so maybe “listen to people on what they have to say” if you don’t want to be rude. That was my learning from that event.</p><p>I quit playing football in school after that incident. But I still played street football where there is no coach or captain - lol (and no self-doubt). Just a plain field and a football with some good old friends near my house.</p><p>uff, damn this was heavy for me - I have never shared this moment with anyone and it’s been bugging me for a long time (more than 10 years). But here it is in the writing.</p><h2 id="Team-party"><a href="#Team-party" class="headerlink" title="Team party"></a>Team party</h2><p>I think it was 2016 or 17. I started working as an engineer for a startup. A lot of things were new to me at that point - especially the place and people. I started working in Bangalore and I came from a small town. I was getting adjusted to the new job and my circumstance there. There was a culture shift that I had to get used to. I had to learn and unlearn some things. I learned it the hard way.</p><p>At my place, we address most people as “sir/madam” or “brother/sister”. We were taught that it is the right way to give respect by default. So, I always addressed people that way and I never had complaints about it. At work, I was informed that the norm at the workplace was to refer everybody by just their name. So, I did my best to unlearn my habit and addressed everybody with their name except one. (retrospect: my fault, I shouldn’t have made this exception)</p><p>The exception I made was to an engineer who spoke the native language as mine. I spoke in English to everybody in the company except this person. We spoke in our native language (Tamil) when we met each other in the bean bag spot. Due to my 25 years of experience in adding “anna” (meaning brother in the native language) at the end or beginning of a sentence when talking with someone of higher age groups, my dialogues heavily included it. I was lonely and it felt home when talking to this person mostly because he was the only one to speak in the same native languages as me in a new world that I was part of. That person told me not to refer him as “anna” but instead just use his name to address him. Well, my mind couldn’t accept it - I was trying to be respectful, and having that word is far more natural while trying to address someone like him back in my home place. But it wasn’t my home place - lol, that was the disconnect that I didn’t understand. I mostly continued using that word and he didn’t show any “strong” opposition about it. Until…</p><p>There was a team party. (I think it was my first time stepping into what they call a “pub”)</p><p>I don’t drink alcohol and I requested some fresh juice - lol (I still do this). I think I was given non-alcoholic drinks with a lot of sugar and fresh fruits mashed on top of it. Most of the team started drinking and it was long hours of discussion, play, and enjoyment.</p><p>I had the chance to sit near the person that I mentioned previously at some point in that event. I referred to them as a brother in my native language casually and that’s it. The person was on alcohol and maybe the reaction is due to that. They reacted back with what I felt to be my life’s rudest moment. He cursed me back with a bad word in our native language. He said something along the lines of “(some really bad words), I have been asking you to stop calling me that why would you still address me like that”. We were surrounded by a lot of our teammates and luckily no one understood what he said.</p><p>I have never been called out with a bad/curse word in our native language before in my entire life. I never created problems or get myself into such situations. I felt bad that the person whom I was thinking close to home would do something like that to me. I didn’t respond to anything, I just sat there in shock and silently retired home after the event. I never spoke about that event with them afterward.</p><p>It was a great lesson for me. From that point onwards, I usually address people by their names. I never use {sir, madam, brother, sister}. Most of all, I stick with English while communicating at the workplace.</p><p>I wish I learned this lesson from a less-rude experience.</p><h2 id="Ticket-master"><a href="#Ticket-master" class="headerlink" title="Ticket master"></a>Ticket master</h2><p>I was at work. We were seeing a strange bug which was happening randomly. I think it was a pretty serious bug and I witnessed it twice. I had previously mentioned this bug to a senior engineer. When I witnessed the same bug for the second time, I ran taking my laptop to that senior engineer showing it. We started checking the logs and trying to make sense of the situation.</p><p>It was a fresh monday if I remember correctly. A very senior engineer (who was trying to be an aspiring engineering manager) was visiting our office at that time and it was the first time I was seeing them in our office. They came down here to work from the India office for a couple of weeks. They saw us debugging something and came in interrupting our debugging session.</p><p>He talked to me for the first time ever, “what are you doing here?”. I said, “I might have run into some bug, which I am not sure if it is a bug that happens due to my local environment….”</p><p>He asked, “Do we have a GitHub issue for it?”. I said, “No! But before opening it, I wanted to confirm if it is a bug and I needed help from this person”.</p><p>In the last sentence that I said, they didn’t allow me to complete it. Right in the middle of what I was speaking, they again asked in a strong voice, “Do we have a GitHub issue for it?”.</p><p>I repeated “No.”</p><p>They continued asking me, (in a strong tone): “Then why are you wasting everybody’s time? Did you know that you must create a GitHub issue for everything?”. I was trying to explain that “it was not a waste of time to clarify a little bit before opening an issue,……”.</p><p>They didn’t allow me to complete my sentences. They preached to me the process.</p><p>At that point, I felt speechless to talk back to them and I felt the same rudeness as the football match situation.</p><p>(at this point, I guess everybody in the office was looking at us and my eyes were filled with tears)</p><p>I returned to my desk, silently.</p><p>See the pattern here, in both situations: The rudeness is mostly due to some person choosing not to listen to some other person and care to explain back them in a peaceful way.</p><h2 id="Laptop"><a href="#Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Laptop"></a>Laptop</h2><p>I am a bit emotionally attached to machines :D which mainly includes computing devices that I use every day, like my laptop. (call me whatever, but I love the devices that help me to be productive)</p><p>I was working at a place where you could BYOD (bring your own device). Well, this was more of an MBYOD situation (Must bring your own device) situation. The startup didn’t have enough funds to buy laptops for the engineers so everyone had to use their laptop.</p><p>I didn’t exactly have my laptop when joining this company. What I had was a laptop with Windows installed, which was bought recently for my brother (cousin) - kind of like a graduation gift from me to him. I explained my situation to my brother and he was nice enough to spare me his new laptop so that I could use it for a month or two to get a paycheck and buy a laptop for me.</p><p>It was stressful times. I had a lot of commitments and I wasn’t able to buy a new machine for about 6 months. I feel sorry for getting myself into that situation. But I had no choice but to use the laptop that I got as a gift for my brother for work. I think it was Lenovo IdeaPad 145s. During that time, I was trying to be careful to give the laptop like a new one to my brother. So, I didn’t remove Windows 10 and install Linux as I would do usually. I didn’t install much software. I want to be minimal and was planning for a reset before giving him the laptop.</p><p>That is the reason why I kept using Ideapad with Windows at work then. I was able to do the tasks at hand mostly by spinning up a Linux VM on the cloud and using a basic code editor.</p><p>My peer engineers in that office were mostly using Thinkpads, XPS, MacBooks, etc. (lucky for them that they were able to afford it on their own. Poor me, haha.)</p><p>There was this one engineer to whom I had approached about doubt, I guess. They sounded very brilliant with a lot of subject matter expertise. They were trying to use my laptop. Apparently, they were a ThinkPad fan and they started a discussion on how great ThinkPad was with some other ThinkPad fan who was sitting near me - while there was an I/O delay on my laptop. I guess they pressed a bunch of keys and the IdeaPad didn’t respond quickly as they expected.</p><p>Suddenly this brilliant engineer informed me that my IdeaPad is “piece of s*%t” and more heavy words. I felt bad about it. Their words sounded like judging me to be a stupid person for using IdeaPad and Windows. I tried explaining to them that this was a spare machine and I am looking forward to getting a machine of my own. They didn’t seem to care and they just walked away in the middle of the conversation.</p><p>I am ok with the “your laptop is not cool” conversation, but I wish that it was not rude. Maybe all that is needed to make this situation non-rude were these:</p><ol><li>avoid curse words</li><li>ask politely why I preferred this hardware</li><li>listen to what I had to tell for 2 minutes</li></ol><h2 id="Thanks-for-listening"><a href="#Thanks-for-listening" class="headerlink" title="Thanks for listening"></a>Thanks for listening</h2><p>Not sure if somebody read this long post till here but if you have read it so far I want to thank you for listening to me. Because that is step 1 of not being rude to somebody.</p><p>I am sorry if I have been rude to you in some way in the past. I try very hard to be not rude to anyone. If you feel I have behaved rudely anytime, feel free to talk to me about it. I will ask a polite sorry to you and correct myself. I deeply care about you and our friendship.</p><p>A special sorry to everyone who had been rude to me and found a spot on this blog post. You should probably forget that you read this, just like the way I try to forget the rude moments. I have been quite successful in forgetting bad moments. How do I say, because most of this post is an approximation of what I remember from that rude moment. I forgot most of the bad stuff.</p><p>One more thing is, some of these events might not seem rude to someone reading this. But I cried or almost cried in all the above situations. Remember the cultural gaps and workplace diversity. The best we can do is be empathetic to everybody and try respecting what a person might be going through. I wish that no one has to go through this bad feeling of “rudeness” especially at the workplace.</p><h2 id="Takeaways"><a href="#Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways"></a>Takeaways</h2><ol><li>Try not to be rude.</li><li>Try hard not to be rude.</li><li>Try listening to people and treating them in a good way.</li><li>Avoid bad/curse words.</li><li>Apologize if you feel that you had been rude to somebody in some way.</li></ol>]]></content>

(It’s 06:35 here) I happened to pick up a book about personal finance and read through a few pages of it in the past hour.</p><p>I have always felt to be lacking in knowledge about money. So, this is just my attempt at getting better at it a little bit.</p><p>My limited knowledge on personal finance is mostly by reading a few chapters in <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/">Zerodha Varsity</a> (amazing resource, thanks to the people creating it). This time, I have picked up this book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40499078-let-s-talk-money">Let’s talk money</a>. I picked it mostly because I somehow got this book recommendation from a trusted source and the book deals with money in INR (Indian rupee) - makes sure that things discussed in the book are applicable in India.</p><p>So what is this blog post about?</p><p>well, I am planning to note down one or two things that I find interesting about personal finance here. So, in the attempt of that - I will start.</p><p>I learned something that I am going to describe below just by reading the preface of the book. LOL, the book is starting to pay off already?</p><p>It is this concept called FOIR. It stands for <em>Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio</em>.</p><p>I think this is a very good place to start evaluating how we are doing financially. Fixed obligation - is the fixed installments of money that you must be paying every month. Example: EMIs of bank loans. If we ratio that to the monthly income, then boom! we have a number that could tell how a person is doing financially now.</p><p>Let’s take the math-y approach and start with the formula.</p><p>FOIR = total monthly EMIs / monthly income</p><p>If a person is earning 1,00,000 INR per month and they are just paying an EMI of 30,000 INR, then their FOIR is 30%</p><p>The book’s author says that a FOIR of 30% is healthy for an individual.</p><p>Something interesting happened while I googled FOIR to copy-paste the full form of FOIR (haha, I don’t want to be embarrassed for spelling “obligations” wrongly)</p><p>Ok, here is the interesting fact: FOIR is being used by banks to decide loan eligibility for an individual.</p><p>So, it seems like the banks expect a FOIR of less than 50% for a person to be eligible for a loan. (as simple as it is!)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember this incident distinctly from my childhood. I had gone to my uncle’s home and was playing his video game. It was this amazing game of “Road Fighter”. I totally forgot the name of this game and had to google it to get it back now. Just in case if you haven’t heard of this game or forgot about it, here is a small clip from YouTube that might remind you of this super A W E S O M E game.</p><center><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Q5-QNfmsbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></center><p>I was a beginner at video games in general at that time. I played for fun. Of course, I wanted to win. I neither had a strategy nor cared to think about it. I just played again and again with the hope that I would win.</p><p>Well, it took quite a few years (or should I say more than a decade) to get this wisdom about hope:</p><blockquote><p>Hope is not a strategy.</p><p>– Traditional SRE saying (<a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/">Google SRE</a>)</p></blockquote><p>haha! poor me.</p><p>But I was lucky enough to get some guidance in my video game journey early on. My uncle observed my playing style that day.</p><p>I press the joystick buttons like the whole world depended on it. I will never try to slow down the car in Road Fighter. When I hit something, I get more furious and press the joystick buttons crazily - left, right, and center. In simple terms, I would get very real and try to get back on track as quickly as possible. With the same furiousness, I would easily go on to lose the game.</p><p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/5Q5-QNfmsbQ?t=422">This is how a crash looks like in road fighter</a>)</p><p>When I was facing going through a crash that I mentioned above, my uncle exclaimed:</p><p>“Just stop!”</p><p>I stopped playing the game and started listening to my uncle. He then told me the thing that would change the way I played video games forever.</p><p>“When you crash, don’t freak out and press all the buttons or even the move forward button or the (left/right) button in the hope of canceling out the effect of the crash. Instead, take your hands off the joystick (literally don’t touch any keys) until the car stabilizes back. Then move forward.”</p><p>Woah! That was it. I restarted the game and followed this strategy. The result was victory!</p><p>This taught me two things:</p><ul><li>Having a strategy will help you win (even when you face hard times)</li><li>When something is going wrong, don’t go with it - instead <em>“just stop”</em> for a moment.</li></ul><p>Even though I applied those principles while playing video games at that age, I had without my knowledge started applying those principles when I grew up in real life.</p><p>Why do I say that now?</p><p>Because I stayed up all night last night to <em>“just stop”</em> and think about the things that have been happening recently. Whenever I <em>just stopped</em>, I came back with more clarity and a stronger mindset of getting to where I want.</p><p>This is of course not a piece of random advice. It’s the one that helped in winning the games that would have been lost otherwise.</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>So, video games teach a thing or two about life after all. (maybe allow your children to play more?)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday I had the chance to tick off one of the items from my wishlist - “Give a tech talk at a conference”.</p><p>One of the most pivotal points in my career is getting a free ticket to attend a JavaScript conference called <a href="https://jsfoo.in/2015/">JSFoo</a> back in 2015. I enjoyed and still enjoy watching conference talks like JSConf, GopherCon, etc. for hours. They bring in a new perspective, teach something new, help discover awesome people to follow, etc. - Also many thanks to conferences that upload their recording for free on YouTube. I am not sure if you know the consequences of those free videos - they literally helped me build a career :D</p><p>(alright, back to the topic)</p><p>I don’t usually speak up much in real life. But I recently felt that I haven’t been speaking up much about what I am busy doing at work and also some new perspective on CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>At the same time, I discovered that the GitHub Satellite conference is happening soon and CFPs are open for it.</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GitHub Satellite is coming to India (well, virtually)!🎉<br>We want to hear your stories about open source, secure development &amp; DevOps.<br>Submit a proposal to speak at GitHub Satellite India 2021 on March 26-27.<a href="https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh">https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/N4Nxp28rHE">pic.twitter.com/N4Nxp28rHE</a></p>&mdash; GitHubIndia (@GitHubIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia/status/1358001577110368256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>Then struck the thought: Maybe I should give a talk because I am kind of doing some cool DevOps stuff with GitHub Actions at work. Maybe share about it?</p><p>So I headed to #conference channel in our work slack and told that I am planning to write a CFP for the conference and got help in reviewing my CFP. Waited curiously after submitting CFP in a few days because I did it for the first time ever.</p><p>Then came the mail.</p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-cfp-accepted.png" alt="cfp-accepted"></p><p>Got excited so excited at this point :)</p><p>Within some days the conference website was up - <a href="https://githubsatellite.com">https://githubsatellite.com</a></p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-talk-abstract.jpg" alt="abstract"></p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-speaker.jpg" alt="speaker"></p><p>Got even more excited after seeing these :D At this point, I still haven’t written down my talk yet. But passively brainstorming what to share in the talk here and there.</p><p>The conference is virtual - this helped because I am kind of shy, nervous and have definitely had stage fear :D The fact that the conference is virtual gave me a low barrier to entry. Shifted my mindset to it is going to be like being on a zoom call with a co-worker where I am explaining stuff.</p><p>I have found a useful approach to doing new stuff. It is called <a href="https://ted.com">https://ted.com</a> - Whenever I am trying to do something new I try to browse this website for videos dealing with the new stuff. In this case, it is “public speaking”. Guess what there is a playlist that I needed: <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/226/before_public_speaking">Before public speaking</a></p><p>(binge-watched)</p><p>I really liked this video called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_marshall_talk_nerdy_to_me?referrer=playlist-before_public_speaking">Talk nerdy to me</a> in that playlist. It helped in removing my shyness. One other idea that got from that playlist is “talks are essentially idea transferring methodology”. If we had an elegant idea about something that the world, we shouldn’t care about silly things like shyness to stop others from acquiring that idea :D</p><p>In the meantime came the speaker kit from GitHub! They comfortably stocked me with all gadgets that I need for the tech talk.</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GitHubIndia</a> for these lovely gadgets. 🙏❤️<br><br>Deploying them to my desk is the first thing I want to do this weekend 😀👨‍💻 <a href="https://t.co/0r3PyxCeLu">pic.twitter.com/0r3PyxCeLu</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1372945054243774467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>It wow-ed everyone around. Happens every time I receive free goodies :D</p><p>GitHub arranged a speaker coaching session that is optional to attend. I completely went in for it because I knew that it will definitely help me out. It was conducted in batches of speakers. We were supposed to get ready with the first few slides of our talk and go through them in front of the speaker coach. Then they give us honest feedback and ways to improve.</p><p>I completely bombed my coaching session. I think I was nowhere close to ready for it except that I felt to have nice presentation slides. The speaking coach was brutally honest and kind in what I was doing wrong and how I should go about fixing it. The problem was I had loose ends while talking which gave the idea that I wasn’t confident about what I was talking about.</p><p>From that point onward, things got real :D</p><p>Then came the technical rehearsal where we needed to set up the gadgets we received and check if lightning, audio, video, etc. are good by jumping into a zoom call with the event producers. Followed up by sending over my entire deck of slides to the event organizer and a dress rehearsal.</p><p>Finally, it was happening :)</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friends, I am presenting a lightning tech talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GitHubSatellite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GitHubSatellite</a> (kind of my first-ever proper tech talk 😄)<br><br>If you are interested in learning how we build internal dev tools at <a href="https://twitter.com/HasuraHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HasuraHQ</a>, tune in to <a href="https://t.co/dPngNVra99">https://t.co/dPngNVra99</a> tomorrow at 11:45 AM IST. <a href="https://t.co/kZaDH5bBli">pic.twitter.com/kZaDH5bBli</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1375479210551074818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/YXBFTDdf1-E?t=8766">link</a> to the awesome MCs introducing me and passing me the mic. Wow, that gave me the feel of attending a physical conference.</p><p>Finally, here is the recording of my first-ever conference talk.</p><center><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IeptXqgu_k8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></center><p>Everything went well! I feel that I did better than what I was thinking to do (lol, kind of reliving to write it).</p><p>I would definitely like to thank team <a href="https://twitter.com/githubindia">@GitHubIndia</a> for organizing the conference! They definitely did a great job here _/_</p><p>oh! I forgot to mention, they even sent me some snacks to munch during the conference :)</p><p><img src="/images/gh-snacks.jpg" alt="gh-snacks"></p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>]]></content>
