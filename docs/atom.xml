    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been almost a decade since I started blogging. I have written a total of 106 blog posts during this time on a variety of <a href="https://vishnubharathi.codes/archives/">topics</a>. I guess I never really shared my motivation behind writing all these posts with anyone. So I will use this blog post as a chance to convey it.</p><h2 id="Paying-it-forward"><a href="#Paying-it-forward" class="headerlink" title="Paying it forward"></a>Paying it forward</h2><p>When I was in college, I was trying to learn node.js. None of my teachers or college friends had heard about it. It was so new. I was trying to build a chat app and came across a YouTube video where Ryan Dahl was giving an introduction to node (probably <a href="https://youtu.be/jo_B4LTHi3I?si=XvOgK4zagvA4pr-G">this video</a>). I read a lot of random blog posts about node.js and built stuff with the help of it. The same thing happened with Angular.js or whatever new technology I was trying to learn in college.</p><p>The best way to learn was by watching conference videos and reading blog posts. I have used this formula to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/JC82Il2cjqA?si=dCmJzID8_xUIN578">You can learn anything!</a></p><p>I see sharing what I learn or know here as a way of paying it forward. That is the least that I can do in exchange for what I got.</p><h2 id="Like-a-Journal"><a href="#Like-a-Journal" class="headerlink" title="Like a Journal"></a>Like a Journal</h2><p>I used to write blog posts titled “log x = y” which used to be a weekly round-up of some things that I learned during the week. So in a way, I have used this blog as a journal of things that I learned.</p><p>I don’t always look back at my journal, but when I do I find some little things that make me smile. I moved away from this format because I want to get into writing in-depth posts on a particular topic.</p><h2 id="Dopamine-cycle"><a href="#Dopamine-cycle" class="headerlink" title="Dopamine cycle"></a>Dopamine cycle</h2><p>I recently heard of this advice from Andrej Karpathy while watching his keynote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsTeEkzO9xc&amp;t=245s">here</a>: “keep the dopamine flowing”. </p><blockquote><p>Be aware of your psychology, your brain, how it works, and what it needs to keep going and to keep inspired… Your brain is a reward machine and it wants rewards and you need to give it rewards.</p></blockquote><p>I find it rewarding when I publish a blog post and people find it useful and talk to me about it. I have had people messaging me, emailing me, talking to me at work, and even in interviews (where I am an interviewer) about some blog post that I wrote. It is a great ice-breaker.</p><p>These blog posts are a way for me to keep the dopamine cycle going - I wish I had posted more on this blog to keep the cycle running! </p><h2 id="Always-read-the-comments"><a href="#Always-read-the-comments" class="headerlink" title="Always read the comments"></a>Always read the comments</h2><p>I heard this advice from Sam Altman a long time back: <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/dont-read-the-comments">Don’t Read The Comments</a>. It was targeted towards people building new projects and startups. I guess the opposite of that advice applies to people who are writing blog posts to share knowledge: “Always read the comments”</p><p>I have had a few instances where my posts ended up on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">the orange site</a> or similar places on the internet. Often times I get to learn more from the comments than the blog post itself by reading through all the comments (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27410910">an example here</a>). Comments are a great way to get feedback and learn from others.</p><h2 id="Free-and-open"><a href="#Free-and-open" class="headerlink" title="Free and open"></a>Free and open</h2><p>I like to keep this blog free from ads. I have no intention of pay-walling anything that I write here. You are free to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">share and adapt</a> anything on this website.</p><p>I had my calling after watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ">Internet’s Own Boy</a> documentary: Knowledge is so important for humanity. Access to information is what will truly empower humans in this information age.</p><p>In my case, the access to those blog posts which were free and open empowered me to learn and grow. It helped me achieve my dream of working in tech. Imagine if all those information were locked behind some paywall.</p><h2 id="Timeless"><a href="#Timeless" class="headerlink" title="Timeless"></a>Timeless</h2><p>I <em>really</em> <em>really</em> want to write blog posts that are timeless. I believe I have written a few such posts in this blog (I will leave it as a reader’s exercise to identify those posts 😅)</p><p>You can find many technical blog posts in this blog but the problem is that tech can become outdated (but I still want to write them because they serve a different purpose).</p><p>My main motivation for continuing to contribute to this blog is to capture and create timeless wisdom. I see it as a kind of wealth.</p><h2 id="Head-fake"><a href="#Head-fake" class="headerlink" title="Head fake"></a>Head fake</h2><p>If you haven’t watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Randy Pausch Last Lecture: Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a>, you should stop reading this blog post and finish watching that first!</p><p>I will summarize what happens in that video: Professor Randy Pausch shared a lot of timeless wisdom in that video. He introduced me to the word “head fake” which he references in the talk.</p><blockquote><p>He described as a “head fake”, for example, the phenomenon of parents encouraging their children to play football. Parents tell their children to play sports not because they really want them to become football stars, he said, but to help them develop collaboration and socializing skills</p></blockquote><p>This is going to be a spoiler if you haven’t watched the video yet. Towards the end of the video, he reveals the second head fake of his talk.</p><blockquote><p>Have you figured out the second head fake?</p><p>This talk is not for you. It is for my kids.</p></blockquote><p>This blog is a head fake. It is for my daughter and sisters.</p><p>This is about the next-gen. What can they learn from my mistakes and experiences? That goes in this blog. As simple as that!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After many long years, I am trying to write a small web UI for a side project.

So I searched if there were any such handlers and found two such functions in the standard library.  So that we could register the handler in our <code>routes</code> ServeMux.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">FileServer</span><span class="params">(root FileSystem)</span> <span class="title">Handler</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">FileServerFS</span><span class="params">(root fs.FS)</span> <span class="title">Handler</span></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The difference between them is their arguments. <code>FileSystem</code> is part of the <code>net/http</code> library and I found this note about it in the comments:</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// This interface predates the [fs.FS] interface, which can be used instead:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// the [FS] adapter function converts an fs.FS to a FileSystem.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> FileSystem <span class="keyword">interface</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">Open(name <span class="keyword">string</span>) (File, error)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So it is a deprecated interface in favor of a new interface. That leaves us with <code>fs.FS</code>.</p><p>It seems like <code>fs.FS</code> is an interface that represents a file system and is present in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs">io/fs package</a>. I remember that they introduced the <code>io</code> package in the standard library to deprecate the <code>ioutil</code> package and this should have been a sweet addition that came with it?</p><p>Anyway, we will choose <code>FileServerFS</code> now.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">routes.Handle(<span class="string">&quot;/&quot;</span>, http.FileServerFS(????))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="A-filesystem"><a href="#A-filesystem" class="headerlink" title="A filesystem"></a>A filesystem</h2><p>So we need a filesystem that we can give to our <code>http.FileServerFS()</code> method. I searched through the possible implementations of <code>fs.FS</code> interface and the first one that I was able to surface is <code>os.DirFS</code>.</p><p>It is a function that gives <code>fs.FS</code> based on the contents of a file system directory.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">routes.Handle(<span class="string">&quot;/&quot;</span>, http.FileServerFS(os.DirFS(<span class="string">&quot;/home/vishnu/pers/gokakashi/webapp/dist&quot;</span>)))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The problem with this approach is, that we will hit troubles when we ship our server to a machine on the internet. Now, someone has to take care of creating <code>/home/vishnu/pers/gokakashi/webapp/dist</code> on the server machine or point to a directory that contains our web app’s assets. That becomes messy, right?</p><p>What I would ideally want is to embed all my HTML, CSS, JS files inside our go server binary itself. That way we ship only the binary and it will be able to serve the web app.</p><h2 id="Baking"><a href="#Baking" class="headerlink" title="Baking"></a>Baking</h2><p>I have heard of the <code>embed</code> package which could be used for embedding files inside the go binary. There is <code>embed.FS</code> which satisfied <code>fs.FS</code> interface. So we could probably use it to bake in our assets.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">//go:embed dist</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> WebAssets embed.FS</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We make use of it like</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">routes.Handle(<span class="string">&quot;/&quot;</span>, http.FileServerFS(WebAssets))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This renders:<br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fa7a78e-eeb1-4aaf-b969-01c38e044777" alt="image"></p><p>(not quite, what we want) Instead of embedding what is inside dist folder, we have embedded the <code>dist</code> folder itself. To inspect what got embedded, we could use the <code>go list</code> command like this:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ go list -f &#39;&#123;&#123;.EmbedFiles&#125;&#125;&#39; .</span><br><span class="line">[dist&#x2F;assets&#x2F;index-n_ryQ3BS.css dist&#x2F;assets&#x2F;index-uO412iEj.js dist&#x2F;assets&#x2F;react-CHdo91hT.svg dist&#x2F;index.html dist&#x2F;vite.svg]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I tried doing <code>//go:embed dist/*</code> instead of <code>//go:embed dist</code>, that didn’t help as well because (from Go docs)</p><blockquote><p>The difference is that ‘image/*’ embeds ‘image/.tempfile’ while ‘image’ does not. Neither embeds ‘image/dir/.tempfile’.</p></blockquote><p>If I used <code>//go:embed dist/index.html</code>, then the file seems to be still embedded with the <code>dist</code> folder.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ go list -f &#39;&#123;&#123;.EmbedFiles&#125;&#125;&#39; .</span><br><span class="line">[dist&#x2F;index.html]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I was wondering if there is a way to embed the contents of <code>dist</code> at the root of the FS instead of the FS directory. There seems to be no provision in the <code>embed</code> package to do it. Because it operates at a package level, and it would force us to declare <code>dist</code> as a separate go package and would force us to remove <code>dist</code> folder from <code>.gitignore</code>. That would be messy.</p><h2 id="Traverse"><a href="#Traverse" class="headerlink" title="Traverse"></a>Traverse</h2><p>We know that we can’t change the root of the file system, but what if we traverse to a folder and get an <code>fs.FS</code> representation that projects the selected directory as the root? I suspected that there might be method to help with that in the <code>io/fs</code> package.</p><p>yep, look what I discovered:</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// Sub returns an FS corresponding to the subtree rooted at fsys&#x27;s dir.</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">Sub</span><span class="params">(fsys FS, dir <span class="keyword">string</span>)</span> <span class="params">(FS, error)</span></span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we just make use of it like this</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">//go:embed dist</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> WebAssets embed.FS</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">New</span><span class="params">(addr <span class="keyword">string</span>)</span> <span class="params">(*Server, error)</span></span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">routes := http.NewServeMux()</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">reactApp, err := fs.Sub(WebAssets, <span class="string">&quot;dist&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> err != <span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">nil</span>, fmt.Errorf(<span class="string">&quot;error finding the dist folder: %w&quot;</span>, err)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">routes.Handle(<span class="string">&quot;/&quot;</span>, http.FileServerFS(reactApp))</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> &amp;Server&#123;</span><br><span class="line">Server: &amp;http.Server&#123;</span><br><span class="line">Addr:    addr,</span><br><span class="line">Handler: routes,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;, <span class="literal">nil</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And boom!</p><p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/150ae840-d520-47e8-9e87-ddf01713614f" alt="Screenshot from 2024-12-21 12-48-57"></p><h2 id="Compile-time"><a href="#Compile-time" class="headerlink" title="Compile time"></a>Compile time</h2><p>The <code>//go:embed dist</code> directive is evaluated during compile time.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is supposed to be a distributed systems blog post that I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vishnubharathi.codes/post/3lcyrndlxvs2u">promised</a> to write, but I am unable to keep quiet about a fact that I realized while thinking about writing this post.</p><p>That is, “I got too many clocks at my home” - like one per room, except the bathrooms. Trying to convince my family to allow me to achieve full coverage, but they just won’t allow me to have a ticking clock in our bathrooms - lol 😂 </p><h2 id="Clock-Skew"><a href="#Clock-Skew" class="headerlink" title="Clock Skew"></a>Clock Skew</h2><p>If you have a lot of clocks like me, then there is a good chance that not all the clocks in all rooms are showing the same time. The clock in my bedroom is five minutes faster than the clock in our hall. That makes me a time traveller when I go from one room to another room.</p><p>The time in my bedroom is 8:35 AM, but the time in my hall is 8:30 AM. If I believe in both of my clocks and walk from my bedroom to the hall, congrats to me because I have travelled back in time.</p><p>It seems like there is a similar situation at hand when you are running multiple different computers. Every machine has its own system clock. There is no guarantee that all the system clocks are having the same time. This difference in time has been causing headaches for programmers and this is what our computer scientists call it to be a “clock skew”.</p><h2 id="NTP"><a href="#NTP" class="headerlink" title="NTP"></a>NTP</h2><p>What if I went through my house all day long and adjusted all the clocks to the same time? Will that make sure to get rid of the clock skew? Not really, the skew can still occur because the seconds hand in real-world clocks cannot be synchronized with one another. There are external factors like the battery power going down which could eventually cause a clock skew.</p><p>In the case of computing, there seems to be a protocol called  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP (Network Time Protocol)</a> that helps do the equivalent of me going around the house and syncing clocks. It synchronizes the clocks between computers and helps us to maintain the clock skew to be minimum. I first heard about it back in 2016 or 2017 at work when we faced some problems due to the clocks going out of sync between the machines in our system. So we had to install the NTP daemon service on all the machines to solve the problem.</p><p>If you are using an NTP daemon in production, make sure to have an alerting and monitoring setup for it. I learned that some people go to the extremes of plotting graphs against the clock skew and network latency between the machines in their system [^1]. It might be good to have a sense of how much of a clock skew can usually happen while using NTP. 100 to 500 milliseconds seem to be a practical estimate for clock skews [^2].</p><h2 id="Reference-clocks"><a href="#Reference-clocks" class="headerlink" title="Reference clocks"></a>Reference clocks</h2><p>You might be wondering if two clocks are out of sync, which one does the NTP consider a source of truth and adjust accordingly.</p><p>To understand it, we have to visit where time comes from. Prepare to be amazed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock#History_of_time-measuring_devices">this list</a> of all kinds of ways humans have been finding time so far in history. If you scroll to the bottom of the list, you will find two kinds of clocks that are of interest to us here.</p><h3 id="Quartz-clock"><a href="#Quartz-clock" class="headerlink" title="Quartz clock"></a>Quartz clock</h3><blockquote><p>Quartz clocks are timepieces that use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator">electronic oscillator</a> regulated by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz">quartz</a> crystal to keep time. [^3]</p></blockquote><p>If you ever wondered how your laptop shows the right time when you switch it off and turn it on after a month. The reason is that your laptop contains a quartz clock with a separate battery which runs always. When your operating system boots up, it gets the time from this clock.</p><h3 id="Atomic-clock"><a href="#Atomic-clock" class="headerlink" title="Atomic clock"></a>Atomic clock</h3><blockquote><p>An atomic clock is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock">clock</a> that measures time by monitoring the resonant frequency of atoms. [^4]</p></blockquote><p>Atomic clocks are the most accurate clocks in existence as of now. In fact, it is so accurate that we have to infer what a second is by using it 🤯 </p><blockquote><p>The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s−1.</p></blockquote><p>While storing date-time values in your applications, you might have heard of Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC).</p><blockquote><p>UTC is based on TAI, which is a weighted average of hundreds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock">atomic clocks</a> worldwide.</p></blockquote><p>Now you know how UTC is calculated! If you install NTP on your machines, it will use UTC as the reference time to adjust the clock skew on your machine.</p><p>Satellites (with atomic clocks installed on them) seem to be the ultimate reference clock. GPS receivers can get signals from these satellites about what time it is. NTP uses different levels of reference clocks and these levels are called startum. The atomic clock in the satellite is the stratum 0 which is the reference clock for stratum 1 and so on. [^5]</p><h2 id="Clock-bound"><a href="#Clock-bound" class="headerlink" title="Clock bound"></a>Clock bound</h2><p>We know that we can’t trust our clocks anymore. Big giants like Google and AWS have been thinking about what they can do to improve the situation. As a result, they set up the fancy stratum 0 atomic clocks on satellites connected to their data center regions. Clock skew is inevitable, but with this fancy setup, they are able to achieve clock skews that are within certain bounds.</p><blockquote><p>In Spanner’s case, Google mentions an upper bound of 7ms…..</p></blockquote><p>This means two machines that are part of the spanner cluster can at-most be of 7ms apart. They cleverly use this property:</p><blockquote><p>So how does Spanner use TrueTime to provide linearizability given that there are still inaccuracies between clocks? It’s actually surprisingly simple. It waits. Before a node is allowed to report that a transaction has committed, it must wait 7ms. Because all clocks in the system are within 7ms of each other, waiting 7ms means that no subsequent transaction may commit at an earlier timestamp, even if the earlier transaction was committed on a node with a clock which was fast by the maximum 7ms. Pretty clever. [^6] </p></blockquote><p>Some interesting things to explore here would be:</p><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency">Google’s TrueTime</a></li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-the-amazon-time-sync-service/">Amazon’s Time Sync Service</a></li><li>AWS’s <a href="https://github.com/aws/clock-bound">clockbound library</a> can give you a timestamp and the bounds of the timestamp which can be used by your application running on EC2.</li></ul><h2 id="Causal-Ordering"><a href="#Causal-Ordering" class="headerlink" title="Causal Ordering"></a>Causal Ordering</h2><p>All the above were attempts to make the clock to be more “trustable”. There is another extreme where things get even more interesting.</p><p>To get there, the first thing you need to note is: It is “causal ordering” and not “casual ordering”.</p><p>Causal means “one” thing in a system <em>caused</em> some other thing in the system. If it was not for the first thing, the things that come after that would have never happened.</p><p>I sent some money to my friend and they received it in their bank account. Sending the money is the event that causes the money to be received in my friend’s account. It can’t be the other way around: My friend received some money out of nowhere and then I sent the money which went nowhere but got detected from my account - there is no causal order here.</p><p>If you think deeply, we need a clock in most of the distributed systems because we just like to have causal ordering of events happening in our system. Be it an e-commerce app or a banking app, the order in which events flow is what we are interested in.</p><h2 id="Logical-clocks"><a href="#Logical-clocks" class="headerlink" title="Logical clocks"></a>Logical clocks</h2><p>This is where things get exciting even more! Let us say we ditch our system clock altogether.</p><p>Instead of a system clock both our server(s) and client would have their own clock (typically as a shared library). Instead of observing the real-world time from this custom clock, our application logic could observe a monotonically increasing counter value. This counter value could give a number that the event can record and increment for the next event to use.</p><p>Do you see what we did here? Instead of storing “event A” that happened at a particular time <code>hh:mm:ss</code>, we record that event A happened as the Nth event in our system. If we sort the numbers stored alongside the event, we get the causal ordering of events. This can help us ensure things like my friend doesn’t get money out of nowhere.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> Clock <span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">time <span class="keyword">uint64</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">mu sync.RWMutex</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="params">(c *Clock)</span> <span class="title">Time</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="title">uint64</span></span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">c.mu.RLock()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">defer</span> c.mu.RUnlock()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> c.time</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="params">(c *Clock)</span> <span class="title">Increment</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="title">uint64</span></span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">c.mu.Lock()</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">defer</span> c.mu.Unlock()</span><br><span class="line">c.time++</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> c.time</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Both our server and client would have their own clocks.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> Server <span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">clock *Clock</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> Client <span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">clock *Clock</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And how do we synchronize the time between them?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want you to read this post if you are at the verge of quitting your job.</p><p>You want to quit this job because you are unhappy.</p><p>Unhappy about what? recent changes in your team, a culture shift? or maybe the thought that work is not fun here anymore? or maybe you are worried that you are going to get laid off? or maybe you feel that you are being undervalued? or maybe you feel that you are being underpaid? or maybe some other thing(s).</p><p>That’s a lot of “maybe”s. It doesn’t matter what the reason is, because the thing is, “you are unhappy” and you must do something about it.</p><p>Ok, so what can you do about it?</p><p>I realized that we have two options here.</p><p>Option one: shut up.</p><p>Option two: fix up.</p><p>Shut up means you literally shut up, grind your nights and weekends, focus on finding a new job, and quit your current job.</p><p>Fix up is a messy route. I have seen the best engineers whom I have worked with to shy away from this path. It takes a certain level of clarity, courage, and bravery to pull it off. (especially if you are living paycheck to paycheck like me - lol)</p><p>Here is how to fix up. You write down all the things that you are unhappy about on a piece of paper. Promise me that you will be brutally honest with yourself while writing this list. And here is the difficult part: You are going to go to your leadership team and share that you are unhappy and read them the list that you prepared. That usually means scheduling a call with your manager, or your manager’s manager (in case of a larger org), or your CEO (in case of startups). Meet up with the person you are most comfortable with (and that ideally will be your manager and in some unfortunate circumstances not).</p><p>Fix up will not just try to fix the situation for you. It has the potential to fix the situation for your colleagues who are in the same boat as you. It is going to empower your leadership team to do the right things. It can even save the entire company.</p><p>Here is a side note for people who are in leadership roles who are reading this post: The best thing that you can do for your team is to create an environment where one feels to “fix up” without having to get an offer letter from another company. I don’t know how exactly you are going to do it but I will leave it as an activity for the readers.</p><p>Back to you now. I want you to seriously consider this path because it might be the shortest path to regain your happiness.</p><p>If you are in good hands, your leaders are going to empathize with you and act upon the feedback that you give them or find a way to help you. I will give you an example: I tried to “fix up” before in one of my previous jobs (but with a new job offer though - I was such a coward, lol). I spoke with the CEO and my reason was “work was not fun anymore”. The CEO acted immediately. He had a bunch of interesting work for which he was not finding time/people to do. He proposed I team up with him and try it out. So for the next few months, I reported to him directly and we tackled the project. That made me regain happiness and at the same time helped the company move on to the next phase.</p><p>I mentioned courage and bravery at the start because you have to try to “fix up” without getting a new job offer. In my above case, I did with an offer and that is a waste of time for you and the people who chose to interview you. Imagine all the time I spent preparing for interviews and all the time and energy of the company (that extended an offer) spent interviewing me. Imagine all the things that I could have done (like watching Cartoon Network or something) instead of preparing all those nights and it is such a waste to decline job offers.</p><p>So, go ahead, be brave, and fix up!</p><p>Best case, you are happy again.</p><p>Worst case, what is going to happen? Your leadership team doesn’t act up on it. I can hear the paranoid human inside you screaming, “What if they blackmark me for saying things aloud? Are they going to fire me because I am not a culture fit anymore?”. I will run by your script here. Let us hit your deepest fear, “They are going to fire me”. Well, what if they do fire you? What are you going to do?</p><p>You are going to prepare full-time for interviews sitting at your comfy little house and appear for interviews and get a new job. And you are happy again.</p><p>The reason why one might not choose to fix up is because they already gave up hope on their leaders or it could be that they don’t understand the cost of switching jobs. Switching jobs is a costly act, you know! Both for you and the company. Especially in startups where one person gets to work on a lot of diverse stuff. Think about the struggle that your colleagues and your company might go through when you choose to leave them. Kind of sad, right? I am not suggesting that you should not switch jobs at all (lol, look at my LinkedIn) - you should switch if that is what makes you happy again. Remember “your happiness” is your core metric. When you are happy, you can make wonders happen and do your best work. But I guess your company usually deserves a fix up if you think it is going to help the company (with or without you).</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~</p><p>I would like to thank <a href="https://svs.io">svs</a> for listening to me through a career chat and offering his suggestions. That conversation made me think about and write down this blog post. BTW, if you are looking for a new job, you have to <a href="https://recruit.svs.io/">talk to him</a>.</p><p>And thanks to <code>git rebase -i</code> - that is where I copied the word “fix up” from.</p>]]></content>

Let us say our program makes 80 calls from <code>LoanAPIClient</code> initially and then makes 200 calls from <code>PaymentAPIClient</code>. By default <code>DefaultClient</code> only maintains 100 maximum idle connections. So, <code>LoadAPIClient</code> will capture 80 spots in those 100 spots, and <code>PaymentAPIClient</code> will only get 20 remanining spots. This means that for the rest of 60 calls from <code>PaymentAPIClient</code>, a new connection needs to be opened and closed. This will cause unnecessary pressure on the payments API server.

So, it might be beneficial to have a separate <code>http.Client</code> for these services. That way we can fine-tune them if needed in the future.</p><figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> LoanAPIClient <span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">client *http.Client</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">type</span> PaymentAPIClient <span class="keyword">struct</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">client *http.Client</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="It-is-fine"><a href="#It-is-fine" class="headerlink" title="It is fine"></a>It is fine</h2><p>The conclusion would be this: It is okay to use <code>http.DefaultClient</code> to start with. But if you think you will have more clients and will make more API calls, avoid it.</p><p>Bonus: If you are authoring a library that has an API client, do a favor for your users: provide a way to customize the <code>http.Client</code> that you are using to make API calls. That way, your users have full control of what they would like to achieve while using your client.</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~</p><p>HTTP Clients inside an HTTP Server talking to another HTTP Server that has HTTP Clients, all authored by you.
