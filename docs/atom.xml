    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning! (It‚Äôs 06:35 here) I happened to pick up a book about personal finance and read through a few pages of it in the past hour.</p><p>I have always felt to be lacking in knowledge about money. So, this is just my attempt at getting better at it a little bit.</p><p>My limited knowledge on personal finance is mostly by reading a few chapters in <a href="https://zerodha.com/varsity/">Zerodha Varsity</a> (amazing resource, thanks to the people creating it). This time, I have picked up this book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40499078-let-s-talk-money">Let‚Äôs talk money</a>. I picked it mostly because I somehow got this book recommendation from a trusted source and the book deals with money in INR (Indian rupee) - makes sure that things discussed in the book are applicable in India.</p><p>So what is this blog post about?</p><p>well, I am planning to note down one or two things that I find interesting about personal finance here. So, in the attempt of that - I will start.</p><p>I learned something that I am going to describe below just by reading the preface of the book. LOL, the book is starting to pay off already?</p><p>It is this concept called FOIR. It stands for <em>Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio</em>.</p><p>I think this is a very good place to start evaluating how we are doing financially. Fixed obligation - is the fixed installments of money that you must be paying every month. Example: EMIs of bank loans. If we ratio that to the monthly income, then boom! we have a number that could tell how a person is doing financially now.</p><p>Let‚Äôs take the math-y approach and start with the formula.</p><p>FOIR = total monthly EMIs / monthly income</p><p>If a person is earning 1,00,000 INR per month and they are just paying an EMI of 30,000 INR, then their FOIR is 30%</p><p>The book‚Äôs author says that a FOIR of 30% is healthy for an individual.</p><p>Something interesting happened while I googled FOIR to copy-paste the full form of FOIR (haha, I don‚Äôt want to be embarrassed for spelling ‚Äúobligations‚Äù wrongly)</p><p>Ok, here is the interesting fact: FOIR is being used by banks to decide loan eligibility for an individual.</p><p>So, it seems like the banks expect a FOIR of less than 50% for a person to be eligible for a loan. (as simple as it is!)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember this incident distinctly from my childhood. I had gone to my uncle‚Äôs home and was playing his video game. It was this amazing game of ‚ÄúRoad Fighter‚Äù. I totally forgot the name of this game and had to google it to get it back now. Just in case if you haven‚Äôt heard of this game or forgot about it, here is a small clip from YouTube that might remind you of this super A W E S O M E game.</p><center><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Q5-QNfmsbQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></center><p>I was a beginner at video games in general at that time. I played for fun. Of course, I wanted to win. I neither had a strategy nor cared to think about it. I just played again and again with the hope that I would win.</p><p>Well, it took quite a few years (or should I say more than a decade) to get this wisdom about hope:</p><blockquote><p>Hope is not a strategy.</p><p>‚Äì Traditional SRE saying (<a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/">Google SRE</a>)</p></blockquote><p>haha! poor me.</p><p>But I was lucky enough to get some guidance in my video game journey early on. My uncle observed my playing style that day.</p><p>I press the joystick buttons like the whole world depended on it. I will never try to slow down the car in Road Fighter. When I hit something, I get more furious and press the joystick buttons crazily - left, right, and center. In simple terms, I would get very real and try to get back on track as quickly as possible. With the same furiousness, I would easily go on to lose the game.</p><p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/5Q5-QNfmsbQ?t=422">This is how a crash looks like in road fighter</a>)</p><p>When I was facing going through a crash that I mentioned above, my uncle exclaimed:</p><p>‚ÄúJust stop!‚Äù</p><p>I stopped playing the game and started listening to my uncle. He then told me the thing that would change the way I played video games forever.</p><p>‚ÄúWhen you crash, don‚Äôt freak out and press all the buttons or even the move forward button or the (left/right) button in the hope of canceling out the effect of the crash. Instead, take your hands off the joystick (literally don‚Äôt touch any keys) until the car stabilizes back. Then move forward.‚Äù</p><p>Woah! That was it. I restarted the game and followed this strategy. The result was victory!</p><p>This taught me two things:</p><ul><li>Having a strategy will help you win (even when you face hard times)</li><li>When something is going wrong, don‚Äôt go with it - instead <em>‚Äújust stop‚Äù</em> for a moment.</li></ul><p>Even though I applied those principles while playing video games at that age, I had without my knowledge started applying those principles when I grew up in real life.</p><p>Why do I say that now?</p><p>Because I stayed up all night last night to <em>‚Äújust stop‚Äù</em> and think about the things that have been happening recently. Whenever I <em>just stopped</em>, I came back with more clarity and a stronger mindset of getting to where I want.</p><p>This is of course not a piece of random advice. It‚Äôs the one that helped in winning the games that would have been lost otherwise.</p><p>~ ~ ~ ~ </p><p>So, video games teach a thing or two about life after all. (maybe allow your children to play more?)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday I had the chance to tick off one of the items from my wishlist - ‚ÄúGive a tech talk at a conference‚Äù.</p><p>One of the most pivotal points in my career is getting a free ticket to attend a JavaScript conference called <a href="https://jsfoo.in/2015/">JSFoo</a> back in 2015. I enjoyed and still enjoy watching conference talks like JSConf, GopherCon, etc. for hours. They bring in a new perspective, teach something new, help discover awesome people to follow, etc. - Also many thanks to conferences that upload their recording for free on YouTube. I am not sure if you know the consequences of those free videos - they literally helped me build a career :D</p><p>(alright, back to the topic)</p><p>I don‚Äôt usually speak up much in real life. But I recently felt that I haven‚Äôt been speaking up much about what I am busy doing at work and also some new perspective on CI/CD pipelines.</p><p>At the same time, I discovered that the GitHub Satellite conference is happening soon and CFPs are open for it.</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GitHub Satellite is coming to India (well, virtually)!üéâ<br>We want to hear your stories about open source, secure development &amp; DevOps.<br>Submit a proposal to speak at GitHub Satellite India 2021 on March 26-27.<a href="https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh">https://t.co/uDsbubEIyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/N4Nxp28rHE">pic.twitter.com/N4Nxp28rHE</a></p>&mdash; GitHubIndia (@GitHubIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia/status/1358001577110368256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>Then struck the thought: Maybe I should give a talk because I am kind of doing some cool DevOps stuff with GitHub Actions at work. Maybe share about it?</p><p>So I headed to #conference channel in our work slack and told that I am planning to write a CFP for the conference and got help in reviewing my CFP. Waited curiously after submitting CFP in a few days because I did it for the first time ever.</p><p>Then came the mail.</p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-cfp-accepted.png" alt="cfp-accepted"></p><p>Got excited so excited at this point :)</p><p>Within some days the conference website was up - <a href="https://githubsatellite.com">https://githubsatellite.com</a></p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-talk-abstract.jpg" alt="abstract"></p><p><img src="/images/gh-satellite-speaker.jpg" alt="speaker"></p><p>Got even more excited after seeing these :D At this point, I still haven‚Äôt written down my talk yet. But passively brainstorming what to share in the talk here and there.</p><p>The conference is virtual - this helped because I am kind of shy, nervous and have definitely had stage fear :D The fact that the conference is virtual gave me a low barrier to entry. Shifted my mindset to it is going to be like being on a zoom call with a co-worker where I am explaining stuff.</p><p>I have found a useful approach to doing new stuff. It is called <a href="https://ted.com">https://ted.com</a> - Whenever I am trying to do something new I try to browse this website for videos dealing with the new stuff. In this case, it is ‚Äúpublic speaking‚Äù. Guess what there is a playlist that I needed: <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/226/before_public_speaking">Before public speaking</a></p><p>(binge-watched)</p><p>I really liked this video called <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_marshall_talk_nerdy_to_me?referrer=playlist-before_public_speaking">Talk nerdy to me</a> in that playlist. It helped in removing my shyness. One other idea that got from that playlist is ‚Äútalks are essentially idea transferring methodology‚Äù. If we had an elegant idea about something that the world, we shouldn‚Äôt care about silly things like shyness to stop others from acquiring that idea :D</p><p>In the meantime came the speaker kit from GitHub! They comfortably stocked me with all gadgets that I need for the tech talk.</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GitHubIndia</a> for these lovely gadgets. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>Deploying them to my desk is the first thing I want to do this weekend üòÄüë®‚Äçüíª <a href="https://t.co/0r3PyxCeLu">pic.twitter.com/0r3PyxCeLu</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1372945054243774467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>It wow-ed everyone around. Happens every time I receive free goodies :D</p><p>GitHub arranged a speaker coaching session that is optional to attend. I completely went in for it because I knew that it will definitely help me out. It was conducted in batches of speakers. We were supposed to get ready with the first few slides of our talk and go through them in front of the speaker coach. Then they give us honest feedback and ways to improve.</p><p>I completely bombed my coaching session. I think I was nowhere close to ready for it except that I felt to have nice presentation slides. The speaking coach was brutally honest and kind in what I was doing wrong and how I should go about fixing it. The problem was I had loose ends while talking which gave the idea that I wasn‚Äôt confident about what I was talking about.</p><p>From that point onward, things got real :D</p><p>Then came the technical rehearsal where we needed to set up the gadgets we received and check if lightning, audio, video, etc. are good by jumping into a zoom call with the event producers. Followed up by sending over my entire deck of slides to the event organizer and a dress rehearsal.</p><p>Finally, it was happening :)</p><center><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Friends, I am presenting a lightning tech talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GitHubSatellite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GitHubSatellite</a> (kind of my first-ever proper tech talk üòÑ)<br><br>If you are interested in learning how we build internal dev tools at <a href="https://twitter.com/HasuraHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HasuraHQ</a>, tune in to <a href="https://t.co/dPngNVra99">https://t.co/dPngNVra99</a> tomorrow at 11:45 AM IST. <a href="https://t.co/kZaDH5bBli">pic.twitter.com/kZaDH5bBli</a></p>&mdash; Vishnu Bharathi (@scriptnull) <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptnull/status/1375479210551074818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2021</a></blockquote><br></center><p>Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/YXBFTDdf1-E?t=8766">link</a> to the awesome MCs introducing me and passing me the mic. Wow, that gave me the feel of attending a physical conference.</p><p>Finally, here is the recording of my first-ever conference talk.</p><center><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IeptXqgu_k8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></center><p>Everything went well!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is inspired by <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">Julian‚Äôs Mental Models</a>. I will use the explanation in that blog post to explain what it is: </p><blockquote><p>Mental models do two things: they help you assess how things work and they help you make better decisions.</p></blockquote><p>Good! Secretly I have been using mental models for a long long time. It‚Äôs just that I have never formalized and called it a name and probably forget about a model and move on to using/experimenting with some other model periodically. If you have a set of thoughts that you base your actions upon, then that is a mental model for you. I would like to think about Mental models as predicates in discrete mathematics (sorry for the math-y reference, but just couldn‚Äôt resist adding it here :D)</p><p>I used to not care about mental models when there was a trend on Twitter where people write threads about it. I think it was mostly because of the theoretical explanations. So, I am going to stop explaining what mental models and try to write about some mental models that I use/trying-to-use/like.</p><h2 id="Five-Whys"><a href="#Five-Whys" class="headerlink" title="Five Whys"></a>Five Whys</h2><p>This mental model even has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys">Wikipedia page</a> that describes it nicely.</p><blockquote><p>The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda and was used within the Toyota Motor Corporation during the evolution of its manufacturing methodologies. It is a critical component of problem-solving training, delivered as part of the induction into the Toyota Production System.</p></blockquote><p>I learned this technique from when I was working for <a href="https://www.shippable.com/">shippable.com</a> - a lot of work and how things operate inside the company was based on Toyota‚Äôs manufacturing process. They used to even refer to the term ‚ÄúSoftware Manufacturing‚Äù for the vision of what they want the product to do for software development.</p><p>Often I have found myself get to the answer to a problem in less than 5 whys. Sometimes going and fixing all the whys may not be in your control. So, chillax and fix what is within your control.</p><p>The technique is simple: Just ask the question ‚Äúwhy‚Äù five times when you are faced with a problem to find out the root-cause/real problem.</p><p>I use this technique to date to debug software. In fact, we used it just yesterday at work to debug <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/6600">this issue</a>.</p><p>Why did the UI show the wrong version number? Because the base docker image sets an older version number.</p><p>Why is the base docker image setting an older version number? Because the CI build failed but continued anyway with a cached older image.</p><p>Why did the CI build fail but continue anyway? (found the bug in CI script that does not short-circuit on failure.)</p><p>Also did a parallel why based on the second answer.</p><p>Why did the CI build fail? Because there a command-line program that we used in the script was not found.</p><p>Why was the command-line program not found? Because the base image of the build image in CI changed to not have it.</p><p>‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p><p>I can go all day asking why. haha - but I should say that I kind of abuse this technique most of the time like stopping with 3 whys in the interest of time and control. But that is fine and we just have to find peace somewhere, so this might as well be.</p><h2 id="First-Principles"><a href="#First-Principles" class="headerlink" title="First Principles"></a>First Principles</h2><p>This was mentioned in <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">Julian‚Äôs post</a> and is famously used by Elon Musk. I am sure that there is a good chance that you might be using it too. Because I had been using it quite a while.</p><p>Remember those moments at work where you feel nothing is working out. This is one of the models to be used at those times.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat if nothing existed about this problem and you were to build a solution for it completely from scratch?‚Äù </p><p>Example: This software library does not have a feature or does not have the extensibility to add this feature. Ok! What if you wrote this library from scratch? What are your design decisions like in that case? Will your design accommodate the extensibility for the feature that you are aiming for?</p><p>This will try to sink you in deep thoughts - I mean the ones that you think about in the shower and make you ‚Äúforget if you applied soap to your legs‚Äù level of thought.</p><h2 id="Last-Principles"><a href="#Last-Principles" class="headerlink" title="Last Principles"></a>Last Principles</h2><p>First of all, I made up this name ‚ÄúLast Principles‚Äù - because this is the opposite of the first principles mental model.</p><p>But very often useful. You are doing this when you are googling for something.</p><p>When faced with a problem, asking how will I solve it if I were to start from scratch is the first principles approach. Instead, asking how has this problem been solved in various ways and using one of the ways is the last principles approach.</p><p>The last principles are a very critical mental model to have. Because that‚Äôs where the learning and experience happens. You get to see these awesome ways various people are solving the problem you have at hand. It might teach you the best practices and the knowledge that the field has accrued over time. </p><p>oh! and probably save you a ton of time.</p><p>Reading a research paper is last principles. I love the way those papers build upon the knowledge from their reference papers. That reference section is last principles. Getting what I mean? :D </p><h2 id="Regret-Minimization"><a href="#Regret-Minimization" class="headerlink" title="Regret Minimization"></a>Regret Minimization</h2><p>Popularised by Jeff Bezos - also has been mentioned in <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">Julian‚Äôs post</a>. </p><p>Particularly helpful for making big decisions. </p><p>It is as simple as asking this question before undertaking big things:</p><p>‚ÄúWill I regret not doing this when I am old?‚Äù</p><h2 id="Minus-Five"><a href="#Minus-Five" class="headerlink" title="Minus Five"></a>Minus Five</h2><p>This is a mental model that I learned sometime back from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sridhar_Vembu">Sridhar Vembhu</a>. He has this advice for people wanting to bootstrap their own company, ‚ÄúStart from -5 years‚Äù - meaning start working for what you want to build 5 years before actually starting to build it. This includes saving up money for such a long period, gathering skillsets that you need for the business, etc.</p><p>The core idea that I understand from the minus five mindset is that in order to do anything substantially big in life, try to plan and save up for those times. Because you don‚Äôt want to enter the war zone unarmed.</p><h2 id="Measure-them"><a href="#Measure-them" class="headerlink" title="Measure them"></a>Measure them</h2><p>Picked up this mental model from Vinod Khosla. Been using this for a few weeks now and I feel good about it.</p><p>I am linking the awesome talk below from where I learned this.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZcXup7p5-8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>The talk ends where he discusses work-life balance. He firmly believes that it is achievable but we just have to be disciplined about it. Vinod Khosla seems to schedule his time into 15 minutes slots. Early on he had 20 main categories and each 15-minute time slot can belong to one of those categories. One of the important categories for him was ‚Äúhaving dinner with family/kids‚Äù and he started by setting an impossible goal of 25 times per month and eventually achieved it in a year.</p><p>The key part is measuring how he spent his time to make time for something he thinks is very important.</p><p>So, if you are having this problem of ‚Äúnot finding enough time‚Äù, start by measuring time. Once you measure how you spend time, it is way simpler to identify the fluff and be very self-aware about how you are spending time.</p><p>Bonus: I use 1-hour slots, as that is easy to track and gives me more focus by avoiding context switching often.</p><h2 id="Lookout"><a href="#Lookout" class="headerlink" title="Lookout"></a>Lookout</h2><p>Alright, I am going to end this blog up here. I am always on the lookout for life lessons and mental models that make me better and help me. So if you have some mental models based on which you operate, send them my way. I will be happy to learn about them and possibly use them.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine that you need to take the latest source code of a project and deploy it somewhere by creating some artifacts with it. If it is a git project with a few commits, a simple <code>git clone .....</code> would do it. But if it is a project with thousands of commits, then you might be bored of your time waiting for the git clone to complete. This is often the case in CI/CD pipelines - that is where I ultimately learned this trick from :D</p><p>I recently discovered something called shallow clones in git. The idea is simple: instead of getting all the commits of a git repo, the shallow clone only gets the latest commit. The <code>--depth=N</code> flag seems to enable shallow cloning in git where N is the number of latest commits to be fetched.</p><p>Here is an example for comparing how much time you can save:</p><p>I tried cloning the Redis project - <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis">https://github.com/redis/redis</a> which had 10,009 commits while cloning.</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ time git clone git@github.com:redis&#x2F;redis.git</span><br><span class="line">Cloning into &#39;redis&#39;...</span><br><span class="line">remote: Enumerating objects: 29, done.</span><br><span class="line">remote: Counting objects: 100% (29&#x2F;29), done.</span><br><span class="line">remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21&#x2F;21), done.</span><br><span class="line">remote: Total 71995 (delta 11), reused 17 (delta 8), pack-reused 71966</span><br><span class="line">Receiving objects: 100% (71995&#x2F;71995), 91.10 MiB | 375.00 KiB&#x2F;s, done.</span><br><span class="line">Resolving deltas: 100% (51230&#x2F;51230), done.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">real4m15.938s</span><br><span class="line">user0m13.796s</span><br><span class="line">sys0m2.875s</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>So normal clone took <code>4 minutes and 15 seconds</code> to complete.</p><p>Here is the same thing but with a shallow clone</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ time git clone --depth&#x3D;1 git@github.com:redis&#x2F;redis.git</span><br><span class="line">Cloning into &#39;redis&#39;...</span><br><span class="line">remote: Enumerating objects: 937, done.</span><br><span class="line">remote: Counting objects: 100% (937&#x2F;937), done.</span><br><span class="line">remote: Compressing objects: 100% (843&#x2F;843), done.</span><br><span class="line">remote: Total 937 (delta 105), reused 568 (delta 70), pack-reused 0</span><br><span class="line">Receiving objects: 100% (937&#x2F;937), 2.58 MiB | 390.00 KiB&#x2F;s, done.</span><br><span class="line">Resolving deltas: 100% (105&#x2F;105), done.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">real0m12.802s</span><br><span class="line">user0m0.621s</span><br><span class="line">sys0m0.167s</span><br><span class="line"></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Just <code>12 seconds</code></p><p>So fast!</p>]]></content>
